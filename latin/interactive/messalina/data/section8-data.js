    "cena-vino": {
        title: "cena vinoque incaluit",
        translation: '"he was warmed by dinner and wine"',
        device: "Implied Indulgence",
        description: "Tacitus isn't just describing a meal but implying a binge - a man weakened by indulgence, dulled by comfort and alcohol.",
        effect: "Shows the emperor is not in control but drunk and vulnerable, setting up his poor judgment and susceptibility to manipulation."
    },
    
    "femina-misera": {
        title: "femina misera",
        translation: '"the wretched woman"',
        device: "Loaded Pity",
        description: "This phrase carries emotional weight beyond mere description - it suggests Claudius already feels sympathy for Messalina's plight.",
        effect: "Reveals Claudius's weakness and emotional susceptibility, showing he's already being swayed by pity despite her crimes."
    },
    
    "hoc-verbo": {
        title: "hoc enim verbo Claudium usum esse ferunt",
        translation: '"for they say Claudius used this word"',
        device: "Authorial Distance",
        description: "The verb 'ferunt' shows Tacitus isn't committing himself to the claim - a classic technique for suggesting doubt whilst appearing neutral.",
        effect: "Creates sly suggestion of Claudius's weakness whilst allowing Tacitus to maintain apparent objectivity in his reporting."
    },
    
    "languescere-redire": {
        title: "languescere iram redire amorem",
        translation: '"anger was declining, love was returning"',
        device: "Balanced Structure",
        description: "Two matching accusative-infinitive phrases mirror Narcissus's thinking, showing the scales tipping back towards Messalina.",
        effect: "The careful balance emphasises how precariously the situation hangs and how quickly Claudius's emotions can shift."
    },
    
    "uxorii-cubiculi": {
        title: "uxorii cubiculi memoriam",
        translation: '"memory of the marriage bed"',
        device: "Intimate Detail",
        description: "This vivid and deliberately uncomfortable phrase highlights Narcissus's fear of renewed physical intimacy between the couple.",
        effect: "Creates visceral understanding of how easily Claudius might be seduced again through physical memories and emotional manipulation."
    },
    
    "prorumpit-denuntiat": {
        title: "prorumpit denuntiatque",
        translation: '"he bursts forth and orders"',
        device: "Historic Present",
        description: "'Prorumpit' is powerful - the kind of word Virgil uses for the sea surging forth. The historic present makes the moment immediate and frantic.",
        effect: "Signals violent, unstoppable action and creates dramatic immediacy as Narcissus takes decisive control of the crisis."
    },
    
    "qui-aderat": {
        title: "qui aderat",
        translation: '"who was present"',
        device: "Polyptoton",
        description: "This repeats the earlier 'adesset', creating wordplay that contrasts Messalina being summoned to appear with the tribune who will oversee her execution.",
        effect: "Creates bitter irony - someone else is now 'present' to ensure Messalina will never appear before Claudius again."
    },
    
    "ita-imperatorem": {
        title: "ita imperatorem iubere",
        translation: '"thus the emperor was ordering"',
        device: "Imperial Title",
        description: "'Imperatorem' is rare for Claudius in Tacitus, who usually calls him 'princeps'. Here it suggests rare decisive, militaristic authority.",
        effect: "Creates irony since Claudius isn't actually giving the order - it mocks the idea he's finally acting like an emperor when someone else pulls the strings."
    },
    
    "unus-libertis": {
        title: "unus e libertis",
        translation: '"one of the freedmen"',
        device: "Social Commentary",
        description: "Another reminder that freedmen, not senators or generals, are executing imperial decisions in this regime.",
        effect: "Emphasises the inverted power structure where former slaves hold life-and-death authority over the highest in society."
    },
    
    "raptim": {
        title: "raptim",
        translation: '"hastily"',
        device: "Urgency",
        description: "The adverb emphasises the speed and urgency of the mission - there's no time to waste before Claudius changes his mind again.",
        effect: "Creates tension and shows Narcissus's awareness that every moment of delay risks the entire plan falling apart."
    },
    
    "humi-fusam": {
        title: "humi fusam",
        translation: '"prostrate on the ground"',
        device: "Stark Imagery",
        description: "A pitiful image of Messalina collapsed and broken, low on the ground. Tacitus offers no sympathy, just brutal visual fact.",
        effect: "Shows her complete fall from imperial heights to literal and metaphorical rock bottom, emphasising her utter powerlessness."
    }
