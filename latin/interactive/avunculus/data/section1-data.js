        title: "nam ille quoque noctibus utebatur",
        translation: '"for he also used the nights"',
        device: "Parenthetical Comment",
        description: "Pliny inserts this explanatory aside to justify his uncle's early start - Vespasian himself worked through the night, making pre-dawn meetings necessary.",
        effect: "The parenthetical structure creates intimacy between narrator and reader, whilst emphasising the emperor's own dedication to work. This detail validates Pliny the Elder's extreme schedule as appropriate court behaviour."
    },

    "reliquum-tempus": {
        title: "reliquum tempus studiis dabat",
        translation: '"he devoted the remaining time to studies"',
        device: "Key Vocabulary",
        description: "The phrase 'reliquum tempus' emphasises how Pliny the Elder organised his entire day around learning - even official duties were merely interruptions to his true passion.",
        effect: "By framing study time as 'remaining' rather than primary, Pliny subtly shows his uncle's priorities: scholarship filled every available moment between necessary obligations."

    "qui-veterum-more": {
        title: "qui veterum more interdiu levis et facilis erat",
        translation: '"which in the manner of the ancients was light and easy during the day"',
        device: "Relative Clause",
        description: "This long relative clause describing food customs interrupts the main narrative flow, creating a scholarly digression typical of Pliny's epistolary style.",
        effect: "The technical detail about ancestral dining habits demonstrates Pliny's own learned approach whilst characterising his uncle as someone who followed traditional Roman values even in eating."
    },

    "adnotabat-excerpebat": {
        title: "adnotabat excerpebatque",
        translation: '"he made notes and extracted (passages)"',
        device: "Asyndeton",
        description: "The rapid succession of verbs connected only by '-que' creates a sense of continuous, methodical activity.",
        effect: "The breathless rhythm mirrors the uncle's relentless scholarly activity - even leisure time was productive and systematic."
    },

    "nihil-non": {
        title: "nihil...non",
        translation: '"nothing...not"',
        device: "Double Negative",
        description: "The emphatic double negative construction 'nihil...quod non excerperet' strengthens the assertion that absolutely everything was useful.",
        effect: "This creates an absolute statement that emphasises the uncle's thoroughness and optimistic approach to learning - no text was beneath his attention."
    },

    "nullum-librum": {
        title: "nullum librum esse tam malum",
        translation: '"no book to be so bad"',
        device: "Reported Speech",
        description: "Pliny reports his uncle's own words about the value of books, using indirect speech to present his scholarly philosophy.",
        effect: "By quoting the uncle directly, Pliny gives authority to this optimistic view of learning whilst revealing his uncle's generous intellectual character."
    },

    "non-aliqua": {
        title: "non aliqua parte prodesset",
        translation: '"would not be useful in some part"',
        device: "Litotes",
        description: "The understated negative 'non...prodesset' rather than a positive assertion creates modest, scholarly tone.",
        effect: "This restrained language reflects Roman intellectual humility whilst making the point more persuasively - even bad books have redeeming features."
    },

    "quasi-alio-die": {
        title: "quasi alio die",
        translation: '"as if on another day"',
        device: "Simile",
        description: "The comparison suggests that after his brief rest, Pliny the Elder approached study with renewed energy as if beginning afresh.",
        effect: "This simile emphasises the uncle's remarkable stamina and dedication - he could refresh himself so completely that afternoon study felt like a new beginning."
    },

    "quidem-cursim": {
        title: "et quidem cursim",
        translation: '"and indeed hastily"',
        device: "Emphatic Addition",
        description: "'Quidem' adds emphasis whilst 'cursim' provides a final detail about the dinner-time reading being done quickly.",
        effect: "The concluding detail suggests even social meals were opportunities for learning, though necessarily rushed - showing how study permeated every aspect of life."
    }
