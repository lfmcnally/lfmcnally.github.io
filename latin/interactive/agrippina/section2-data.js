    fullTranslation: "Cluvius records that in her eagerness to retain power, Agrippina went so far as to offer herself quite often, adorned and ready for incest, to the drunken Nero in the middle of the day, at that time when Nero was becoming heated through wine and feasting; and already, as those closest were noticing the wanton kisses and caresses that announce scandal, Seneca sought help from a woman against the feminine enticements and Acte, a freedwoman, was sent in, who, anxious both for her own danger and Nero's disgrace, reported that their incest was widely known because the mother was boasting about it, and that the soldiers would not tolerate the rule of an unholy emperor. Fabius Rusticus records that this was desired not by Agrippina but by Nero, and was scattered by the cleverness of this same freedwoman. But what Cluvius (relates), the rest of the authors too have handed down, and rumour inclines this way, whether Agrippina conceived such great monstrosity in her mind, or the contemplation of a new lust seemed more believable in her who in her girlhood years had admitted adultery with Lepidus in hope of domination, with equal desire had prostrated herself even to the whims of Pallas and was practised in every disgrace through marriage to her uncle.",

        summary: `
            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p>Tacitus presents conflicting historical accounts of alleged incest between Agrippina and Nero. According to Cluvius, Agrippina initiated the seduction when Nero was drunk at midday banquets. Seneca intervened by sending Acte to warn Nero about spreading rumours and potential military revolt.</p>
            <p>Fabius Rusticus offers an alternative version where Nero initiated the incest, though Acte still prevented it. Tacitus notes most sources agree with Cluvius and adds Agrippina's sexual history as evidence: affairs with Lepidus and Pallas for power, and incestuous marriage to uncle Claudius.</p>
        `,
        context: `
            <h4>Historical Context</h4>
            <p><strong>The Sources:</strong> Cluvius Rufus was a contemporary historian who likely knew the imperial family personally. Fabius Rusticus was Seneca's friend, explaining his version that exonerates Seneca's intervention.</p>
            <p><strong>The Characters:</strong> Acte was a real freedwoman who had been Nero's mistress before Poppaea. Her low status makes her moral superiority over Agrippina particularly striking.</p>
            <p><strong>Agrippina's Past:</strong> The references are historically attested: Marcus Lepidus was her brother-in-law with whom she allegedly conspired; Pallas was Claudius's powerful freedman secretary; her marriage to uncle Claudius required special senatorial dispensation as it violated Roman incest laws.</p>
            <p><strong>Military Concern:</strong> The emphasis on soldiers' reaction shows where real power lay - moral authority ultimately depended on military support.</p>

        sources: `
            <h4>Source Analysis</h4>
            <p><strong>Historiographical Method:</strong> Tacitus explicitly names his sources, creating apparent objectivity whilst clearly favouring one version. This technique allows him to present scandal whilst maintaining scholarly distance.</p>
            <p><strong>Source Bias:</strong> Cluvius Rufus was writing under the Flavians when vilifying Nero was safe. Fabius Rusticus's friendship with Seneca explains his version protecting Seneca's reputation.</p>
            <p><strong>The Role of Rumour:</strong> Tacitus notes "fama huc inclinat" (rumour inclines this way) - popular opinion becomes evidence, though rumour typically favours the most scandalous version.</p>
            <p><strong>Character Evidence:</strong> Tacitus uses Agrippina's sexual history as "proof" - past behaviour determines present credibility. This is character assassination disguised as logical deduction.</p>
        `,
        themes: `
            <h4>Key Themes</h4>
            <p><strong>Power Through Sex:</strong> Every sexual relationship Agrippina has is transactional - body as political currency. From Lepidus to Pallas to Claudius to (allegedly) Nero, sex serves power.</p>
            <p><strong>Gender Warfare:</strong> "Contra muliebres inlecebras subsidium a femina" - woman fights woman. The battle is gendered, with feminine corruption requiring feminine intervention.</p>
            <p><strong>Social Inversion:</strong> A freedwoman (Acte) has more moral authority than a patrician mother. The palace has inverted normal social hierarchies through corruption.</p>
            <p><strong>Public vs Private:</strong> "Pervulgatum esse incestum" - private shame becomes public knowledge. The scandal's exposure matters more than its truth.</p>
            <p><strong>Military Legitimacy:</strong> Ultimately, soldiers' tolerance determines imperial legitimacy. Moral authority rests on military support, not senatorial approval.</p>
