    <p>Excellent grasp of the narrative flow and storyline. Strong handling of indirect statements ("I promised that I would do"). Good recognition of ablative absolutes in Section 1. Very clear understanding of the overall tale. Vocabulary generally strong with good choices like "sensed", "terrified", "replica".</p>

    <div class="feedback-title">Areas for Improvement</div>
    <p>Watch tense consistency - several present tenses where past is needed. Be careful with person (Section 8: "I said" should be "he said"). Double-check vocabulary: "fugavi" means "chased away", not "fled". Pay attention to details like "ears" vs "eyes" in Section 9. Work on recognizing pluperfect tenses in the later sections.</p>

    <p>Very strong overall performance with excellent narrative comprehension. Particularly good at handling complex grammar: indirect statements, ablative absolutes, and purpose clauses. Creative vocabulary choices that maintain accuracy ("booty" for praemium is perfectly valid). Excellent attention to superlatives ("stupidest", "brief"). Clear, natural English throughout.</p>

  <div class="feedback-box improvements">
    <div class="feedback-title">Areas for Improvement</div>
    <p>Minor spelling issues ("in tact" should be "intact", "lead" should be "led"). Watch for comparative forms - "heavier" rather than "heavy" in Section 4. In Section 8, aim for more literal rendering of the Latin rather than interpretation. Be precise with tense - pluperfect in final sections should be maintained.</p>

    <p>Very strong performance with excellent handling of complex grammar. Outstanding work with ablative absolutes - "With the money accepted, I was delighted" is perfect. Excellent grasp of purpose clauses and indirect statements. Strong recognition of comparatives ("heavier") and superlatives ("most stupid"). Very good passive constructions throughout. Sections 3, 6, and 7 were perfect, showing you can handle both simple narrative and complex grammatical structures excellently when you're careful.</p>

    <p>Watch for completeness - Sections 9 and 10 are missing significant portions of the Latin. Section 1 needs work on ablative absolute structure. Be precise with vocabulary: "carefully" vs "faithfully" (Section 2); "eaten" vs "made of wax" (Section 9). Tense accuracy: "has been killed" should be "had been killed" in Section 8. When translating, make sure you've included all the Latin - your later sections are too short. Overall though, when you include everything, your translation quality is very high!</p>

    <p>Focus on grammatical precision: ablative absolutes need to show subordination (Sections 1 and 6). Watch for superlatives and comparatives - "heavier" not "heavy" (Section 4), "most stupid" not "very stupid" (Section 10). Be careful with pronouns - Section 8 has "her face" when it should be "my face" (major error). Include small but important words like "suddenly" (subito). While your English is very natural, make sure you're capturing all the Latin grammatical structures, not just the sense.</p>

    <p><strong>Outstanding translation - one of the best in the class!</strong> Exceptional grammatical accuracy with perfect handling of ablative absolutes, indirect statements, purpose clauses, and passive constructions. Excellent vocabulary precision throughout ("untouched" for integer, "in alarm" for perterritus, "duty" for officium). Consistent attention to tense, including proper use of pluperfects. Natural, sophisticated English that maintains the formality of the Latin. Your translation demonstrates a very strong command of Latin grammar and translation technique. Particularly impressive: your rendering of complex constructions in Sections 2, 6, 8, and 9.</p>

    <p>These are very minor points in an otherwise excellent translation: In Section 4, watch for the comparative "heavier" rather than "heavy", and include the relative pronoun "which" to connect the weasel clause. In Section 10, avoid adding words like "man of all" that aren't in the Latin, even when they don't change the meaning. These are tiny refinements to an already very high-quality translation. To achieve absolute perfection, focus on capturing every grammatical detail with 100% precision. Excellent work overall!</p>

    <p><strong>Priority areas:</strong> (1) Tense accuracy - many present tenses used where past is needed. Pay special attention to perfect vs pluperfect. (2) Person - "I promised" not "Promise me" in Section 2; "she gave me" not "I will give you" in Section 6. (3) Subordination - work on showing indirect statements and ablative absolutes properly. (4) Comparative forms - "heavier" not "heavy" in Section 4. Practice identifying these grammatical constructions in the Latin before translating.</p>

    <p><strong>Critical issue:</strong> Section 8 appears incomplete - always ensure you've finished translating each section before submitting. Watch vocabulary precision: "carefully" vs "faithfully" in Section 2; "face of the witch" vs "by witches" (major error in Section 2). Remember superlatives: "most stupid" not just "stupid" in Section 10. Be careful with number: "dead bodies" should be singular in Section 6. Double-check your work is complete before submission.</p>

    <p>Outstanding translation with excellent grammatical accuracy throughout. Exceptional handling of complex constructions: ablative absolutes, indirect statements, purpose clauses, and relative clauses all managed perfectly. Impressive vocabulary precision and natural English phrasing. Consistent attention to superlatives, comparatives, and tense. This demonstrates a very strong grasp of Latin grammar and translation technique. Particularly impressive: your use of "lest" in Section 2 and consistent accuracy with deponent verbs.</p>

    <p>Very minor points: Watch for comparative forms - "become heavier" rather than "become heavy" in Section 4. The phrase "of him but of mine" in Section 8, while clear, could be slightly more natural as "his but mine". These are genuinely minor issues in what is otherwise an excellent translation. To push to the very highest level, focus on achieving 100% accuracy with comparatives and ensuring every phrase reads as naturally in English as possible.</p>

    <p><strong>Priority areas:</strong> (1) <strong>Tense accuracy</strong> - many wrong tenses throughout (present for past, simple past for pluperfect). (2) <strong>Vocabulary precision</strong> - "widow" vs "wife", "died" vs "dead", "bodies" vs "body" (singular/plural). (3) <strong>Grammatical structures</strong> - work on recognizing ablative absolutes, indirect statements, and purpose clauses. (4) <strong>Word formation</strong> - "fastly" isn't a word (use "quickly"), "lied" should be "lay". (5) <strong>Sentence structure</strong> - many confused constructions that need clarification. Focus on: identifying the tense of Latin verbs before translating, learning singular vs plural forms, and practising the key grammatical constructions (ablative absolute, indirect statement). Consider working through translations more slowly and checking each word carefully. Don't be discouraged - with focused practice on these core areas, you'll see significant improvement!</p>

<h3>Class Performance Analysis</h3>
<p><strong>Class Average:</strong> 37.0/50 (74%)</p>

<p><strong>Strongest Sections Overall:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Section 3</strong> - Nearly all students achieved 5/5 (simple, straightforward narrative)</li>
  <li><strong>Section 7</strong> - Strong performance across the class (vivum factum est handled well)</li>
  <li><strong>Section 5</strong> - Good recognition of prima luce and perterritus</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Areas Needing Development:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Section 6</strong> - Ablative absolute (pecunia accepta) and correct identification of who gave the reward</li>
  <li><strong>Section 4</strong> - Comparative forms (graviores) and relative pronouns (quam)</li>
  <li><strong>Section 2</strong> - Person (promisi) and subordination with ne clauses</li>
  <li><strong>Section 10</strong> - Pluperfect tenses and maintaining superlatives</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Common Issues Across the Class:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Tense accuracy (especially present used for past, and pluperfect not recognized)</li>
  <li>Comparative and superlative forms</li>
  <li>Ablative absolute constructions</li>
  <li>Person (particularly in indirect statements)</li>
  <li>Vocabulary precision (especially with less common words like sagae, consumeretur)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Teaching Recommendations:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Review ablative absolutes with focused practice on recognition and translation</li>
  <li>Drill comparative and superlative forms</li>
  <li>Practice identifying and translating pluperfect tenses</li>
  <li>Work on purpose clauses and ne + subjunctive constructions</li>
  <li>Vocabulary building for less common words</li>
</ul>
