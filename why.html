The Catholic Church still uses Latin. Scholars worldwide read and publish in Latin. That's not a dead language—it's a language with a different kind of life.</p>

Classics graduates pursue remarkably diverse careers. The analytical, linguistic, and critical thinking skills you develop are highly valued across many fields.</p>

They want graduates who can analyse complex information, construct arguments, write clearly, and think independently. That's exactly what Classics teaches.</p>
                                    <p style="color: #6b7280; line-height: 1.6; font-size: 0.95rem; margin-top: 1rem;">Top consulting firms and investment banks explicitly recruit "any degree discipline" because they value intellectual ability over subject-specific knowledge. A Classics degree proves you can handle difficult material and think rigorously—which is what these employers want.</p>

The ancient world wrestled with fundamental questions about politics, ethics, war, justice, and the good life that remain urgently relevant today.</p>

                                        <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">How do democracies fail and become tyrannies? (Read Plato's <em>Republic</em> or Thucydides on Athenian democracy)</li>
                                        <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">What happens when political polarisation destroys civic discourse? (Read about the fall of the Roman Republic)</li>
                                        <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">How should we treat refugees and foreigners? (Greek tragedy explores <em>xenia</em>—sacred hospitality to strangers)</li>
                                        <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">What are the long-term costs of war, even for "winners"? (The <em>Iliad</em> has much to say about this)</li>
                                        <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">How do propaganda and rhetoric manipulate public opinion? (Roman oratory provides case studies)</li>

Because ancient societies differ from ours, you're forced to question your own assumptions about how societies work. This makes you a better analyst of <em>any</em> historical period, including the modern one.</p>
                                    <p style="color: #6b7280; line-height: 1.6; font-size: 0.95rem; margin-top: 1rem;">The ancient world isn't a curiosity sealed off from modern concerns—it's a rich source of insight into perennial human problems. Many of which we haven't solved any better than they did.</p>

                                    <p style="color: #6b7280; line-height: 1.6; font-size: 0.95rem; margin-top: 1rem;">Classics combines well with virtually any other A-Level: History, English, Philosophy, Politics, Modern Languages, even Sciences and Mathematics. The analytical and writing skills you develop in Classics benefit all your other subjects.</p>
                                    <p style="color: #6b7280; line-height: 1.6; font-size: 0.95rem; margin-top: 1rem;">You don't need Classics to study Classics at university—most courses welcome complete beginners. But having studied it at A-Level gives you an advantage and demonstrates genuine interest in the subject.</p>

It shows intellectual curiosity, willingness to tackle difficult material, and the ability to think independently—exactly what universities look for.</p>

                                    <p style="color: #6b7280; line-height: 1.6; font-size: 0.95rem; margin-top: 1rem;">Second, Latin and Greek are quite different from modern language learning. You're not trying to become conversationally fluent or speak naturally. You're learning to read and analyse texts carefully. This is more like solving puzzles than chatting in French.</p>
                                    <p style="color: #6b7280; line-height: 1.6; font-size: 0.95rem; margin-top: 1rem;">Many students who struggle with modern languages excel at Latin and Greek because:</p>

                                        <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">You can work at your own pace—texts don't talk back or expect quick responses</li>
                                        <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Everything follows logical grammatical rules you can learn systematically</li>
                                        <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">There's no listening or speaking component—it's all reading and analysis</li>
                                        <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">You use dictionaries extensively, so memorising vocabulary is less crucial</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p style="color: #6b7280; line-height: 1.6; font-size: 0.95rem; margin-top: 1rem;">If you enjoy logic puzzles, crosswords, or systematic problem-solving, you might well enjoy ancient languages even if modern languages aren't your strength.</p>

                                    <p style="color: #6b7280; line-height: 1.6; font-size: 0.95rem; margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>1. You demonstrate intellectual range</strong></p>
                                    <p style="color: #6b7280; line-height: 1.6; font-size: 0.95rem; margin-left: 2rem;">Universities and employers want people who can think across different domains. Someone who excels in both physics and Latin shows they can handle abstract logical systems <em>and</em> complex textual analysis. That's rare and valuable.</p>
                                    
                                    <p style="color: #6b7280; line-height: 1.6; font-size: 0.95rem; margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>2. Different skills, same rigour</strong></p>
                                    <p style="color: #6b7280; line-height: 1.6; font-size: 0.95rem; margin-left: 2rem;">Sciences teach you systematic problem-solving and quantitative reasoning. Classics teaches you textual analysis, argumentation, and clear written communication. These aren't competing skills—they're complementary. A scientist who can write clearly and argue persuasively has a massive advantage.</p>
                                    
                                    <p style="color: #6b7280; line-height: 1.6; font-size: 0.95rem; margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>3. You can grapple with fundamentally different material</strong></p>
                                    <p style="color: #6b7280; line-height: 1.6; font-size: 0.95rem; margin-left: 2rem;">Translating Virgil requires different thinking than solving differential equations. Being able to switch between these modes shows cognitive flexibility and intellectual curiosity. It proves you're not just good at one narrow type of problem.</p>
                                    
                                    <p style="color: #6b7280; line-height: 1.6; font-size: 0.95rem; margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>4. You stand out</strong></p>
                                    <p style="color: #6b7280; line-height: 1.6; font-size: 0.95rem; margin-left: 2rem;">Medical school applicants with Chemistry, Biology, Physics, and Maths look identical on paper. Add Latin or Classical Civilisation and you're immediately distinctive. You show there's more to you than just science—you're intellectually curious about the world beyond your specialism.</p>
                                    
                                    <p style="color: #6b7280; line-height: 1.6; font-size: 0.95rem; margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>5. Balance and perspective</strong></p>
                                    <p style="color: #6b7280; line-height: 1.6; font-size: 0.95rem; margin-left: 2rem;">Spending all your time on STEM subjects can be intense. Classics offers intellectual challenge of a different kind—reading Homer or debating Stoic ethics provides variety whilst still demanding serious thought. Many science students find this balance valuable.</p>
                                    
                                    <div class="highlight-box" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                                        <p><strong>Historical precedent:</strong> Many great scientists studied Classics. Isaac Newton was as fluent in Latin as he was in mathematics. Medical training traditionally required Latin. The idea that humanities and sciences are opposed is modern—historically, educated people studied both.</p>
                                    </div>

But adding Classics doesn't dilute that—it enriches it. You become someone who can think scientifically <em>and</em> communicate effectively, who understands both laboratory method and historical context, who has intellectual depth beyond a single discipline.</p>

                    <p>Classics is demanding but rewarding. Whether you're translating Latin poetry, analysing Greek philosophy, or interpreting ancient art, you'll be pushed to think carefully, argue persuasively, and engage with complex ideas.</p>
                    <p>The challenge is part of the appeal.</p>
