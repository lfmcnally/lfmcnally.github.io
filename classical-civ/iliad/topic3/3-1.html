                        <h3>Why Book 4 Matters</h3>
                        
                        <p class="explanation-text">
                            Book 4 is where everything KICKS OFF. Book 1 gave us conflict between Greeks. Book 3 teased us with a possible resolution through single combat. Now? Zeus orchestrates the breaking of sacred oaths, and the full-scale war begins. This is Homer showing you that divine politics matter MORE than human agreements, and that war—once started—has its own terrible momentum.

                                The gods, meanwhile, had sat down in assembly with Zeus on Olympus' golden floor. Lady Hebe served them with nectar, and they drank each other's health from cups of gold as they looked out over the Trojans' town.

                            Notice how casual this is. The gods are literally having drinks while watching mortals prepare for battle. Homer's setting up one of his key themes: the gods are NOT on your side. They're playing their own games, and humans are the pieces.

Their speech and dialects were all different, as they spoke a mixture of languages – the troops hailed from many parts.

                            The Trojan simile is deliberately LESS impressive. Sheep bleating? But Homer's not being entirely unfair—the Trojans are defending their home with allies from across Asia Minor speaking different languages. Unity is harder when you're not a single ethnic group.
