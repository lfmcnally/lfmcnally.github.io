                        <p class="explanation-text">
                            Book 6 is the PIVOT of the entire Iliad. We've seen five books of warfare, death, and masculine honour. Now Homer takes us INSIDE Troy's walls to show us what war COSTS. This is the book that makes Hector human—and makes his eventual death in Book 22 absolutely devastating.

                                Book 6 juxtaposes WAR (battlefield) with HOME (domestic life). We see Diomedes and Glaucus meeting as potential enemies who become guest-friends. Then we see Hector with his wife and baby son. Homer is showing you what's at stake: not just honour and glory, but FAMILIES, LOVE, and NORMAL LIFE.

                            After five books of non-stop warfare, Homer gives us a PAUSE. Book 6 is structurally positioned to make us CARE about the characters before the slaughter intensifies. By showing us Hector as a husband and father, Homer ensures we'll feel his death when it comes.

Glaucus gets MASSIVELY ripped off in this exchange—but he does it anyway because xenia matters more than material value.

This is the first time we've been INSIDE Troy's walls since Book 3. Homer is shifting from the masculine world of battle to the domestic world of home.

                            <p>
                                Andromache has ALREADY lost everyone: father, seven brothers, mother—ALL killed by Achilles or because of the war. Hector is literally the ONLY family she has left. When she says "you are father and lady mother to me, as well as my beloved husband," she means it LITERALLY. Losing Hector means losing EVERYTHING for a second time.

He stroked her with his hand and said: 'My dear, I beg you not to be too distressed. No one is going to send me down to Hades before my proper time. But Fate is a thing that no man born of woman, coward or hero, can escape. Go home now, and attend to your own work, the loom and the spindle, and see that the maidservants get on with theirs. War is men's business; and this war is the business of every man in Ilium, myself above all.'"

                            Hector picks up the helmet—puts his warrior identity back on. Andromache walks away "turning back again and again"—she can't stop looking, knowing this is the last time she'll see him alive. The repetition ("again and again") emphasises her desperate need to hold onto this moment.

                                This scene SETS UP Hector's death.

                            After the tender domestic scene, Homer returns us to WAR. Paris finally emerges from his house (with Helen's prodding), catches up to Hector, and they return to battle together. The book ends with them re-entering the fighting.

                                Book 6 moves from war → home → war. Homer SURROUNDS the domestic scene with violence to show what war destroys. The tenderness of Hector's family makes the battlefield MORE horrifying. We've seen what warriors have to lose—now when they die, we know they're leaving behind wives, children, homes.
