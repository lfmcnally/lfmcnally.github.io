                            Books 4 and 6 shift focus from individual honour disputes (Books 1 & 3) to BROADER questions: What is war actually LIKE? What does it COST? What are warriors fighting FOR? These books juxtapose WAR'S BRUTALITY (battlefield violence) with DOMESTIC LIFE (home, family, love). The contrast is DEVASTATING.

                                <strong>Book 4</strong> = War begins in earnest. Mass slaughter. Individual deaths given names and backstories. This is what war LOOKS like.<br><br>
                                <strong>Book 6</strong> = Hector goes home. Wife, baby son, domestic tenderness. This is what war DESTROYS.<br><br>
                                Homer places these books consecutively to make you FEEL the cost. You can't read Hector with Astyanax without thinking about all the fathers who just died in Book 4.

                                Books 1-3 focused on individual conflicts: Achilles vs Agamemnon, Paris vs Menelaus. Book 4 zooms OUT to show the COLLECTIVE cost. Homer gives us:

                                Homer repeatedly mentions fathers, mothers, wives, children. Simoisius's parents named him after the river where he was born. That's LOVE—giving your child a name that connects him to home. And now he's dead in the dust, far from that river. War destroys these connections.

                                Without Book 6, Hector is just another warrior. WITH Book 6, he's a father, husband, son. When he dies in Book 22, we don't just lose a warrior—we lose EVERYTHING we saw in Book 6: Andromache's husband, Astyanax's father, the man who laughed when his baby cried at his helmet.

                            <span class="greek-term">Xenia</span> (ξενία) = guest-friendship, the sacred bond between host and guest. In Greek culture, this relationship was PROTECTED BY ZEUS HIMSELF. Violating xenia was one of the worst sins possible. And xenia was HEREDITARY—if your grandfather hosted someone, you owe that person's descendants hospitality forever.

                                Greeks and Trojans are ENEMIES. They're supposed to kill each other. But xenia creates bonds that OVERRIDE war alliances. Book 6 shows this through Diomedes and Glaucus: two warriors who meet as opponents but discover their grandfathers were guest-friends. Result? They DON'T fight.
                            </p>

                                This demonstrates that even in war, there are VALUES that transcend conflict. Xenia is more important than victory.

                            <p>
                                Oaths were the FOUNDATION of Greek society. No written contracts—just sworn promises witnessed by gods. Breaking an oath was inviting divine punishment. Zeus himself punishes oath-breakers.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But Book 4 shows: what happens when GODS THEMSELVES orchestrate oath-breaking? Who's responsible—the mortal who shoots (Pandarus) or the goddess who manipulates (Athene)?

                                Oaths in Book 4 involve EVERYONE (armies, leaders, gods as witnesses)—too many players, too much at stake, gods interfere. Xenia in Book 6 is PERSONAL (just Diomedes and Glaucus)—intimate, individual choice, gods don't intervene. Homer suggests: personal bonds can survive where collective agreements fail.

                                Is Hector's heroism ADMIRABLE (facing fate bravely) or WASTEFUL (dying for nothing)? Homer doesn't answer. He shows you BOTH: the nobility of Hector's courage AND the futility of fighting for Troy. The audience must decide: is it better to die honourably for a lost cause, or live "shamefully" and survive?

                            <p>
                                Every warrior in Book 4 who dies—Simoisius, Echepolus, Democoön—they ALL made Hector's choice: fight despite the possibility of death. Some chose glory (like Hector), others had no choice (conscripted). But ALL end up "face down in the dust." Book 6 makes us sympathise with ONE warrior (Hector) so we understand ALL the deaths in Book 4. They weren't just bodies—they were fathers, sons, husbands.

                            <h5>Sample Essay Paragraph: Integrating Multiple Themes</h5>
                            <p>
                                "Homer's structural placement of Book 6's domestic scene directly after Book 4's battlefield slaughter creates devastating dramatic irony. Book 4 shows war's brutality through individualised deaths like Simoisius, whose 'life was too short to repay his parents for their loving care' (4.478-479). This emphasis on parental loss sets up Book 6's emotional core: Hector holding his infant son Astyanax while praying for his future. The audience knows—as Hector himself knows ('the day will come when sacred Ilium will be destroyed', 6.447-449)—that this prayer will never be answered. Hector's acceptance of fate ('Fate is a thing that no man born of woman, coward or hero, can escape', 6.488-489) paradoxically drives him to return to battle, creating the tragic cycle: he fights BECAUSE he knows death is inevitable, not despite it. The contrast between Book 4's mass slaughter and Book 6's intimate domesticity demonstrates Homer's central argument: war destroys precisely what makes life worth living. When Andromache takes Astyanax 'to her fragrant breast, laughing through her tears' (6.484), Homer captures the simultaneity of joy and impending loss that defines the heroic experience."

                                Book 4 shows you WAR: brutal, bloody, deadly. Bodies piling up. Families destroyed. Book 6 shows you HOME: tender, loving, precious. Everything worth protecting. Then Book 6's ending makes clear: the home WON'T be protected. Hector returns to war knowing Troy will fall. His baby son will be murdered. His wife will be enslaved. But he goes anyway because NOT going would destroy who he is. This is the Iliad's tragedy: the heroic code REQUIRES men to destroy what they love most. Courage and love are incompatible when fate is fixed.
