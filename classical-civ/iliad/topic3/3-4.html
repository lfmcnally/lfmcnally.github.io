                            Books 4 and 6 give us three crucial character studies: Diomedes (the ideal warrior in action), Hector (the defender caught between duty and love), and Andromache (the war's civilian victim). Together, they show us different faces of the Trojan War: glory, responsibility, and loss.

                                <strong>Book 6:</strong> Homer pulls us from battlefield to bedroom, showing Hector's farewell to Andromache—what heroism COSTS those left behind.

                                Son of Tydeus, king of Argos, one of the younger Greek leaders. Books 4-6 are his aristeia—his "moment of excellence" when he dominates the battlefield. With Achilles sulking by the ships, Diomedes steps up to fill the gap. He's everything a hero SHOULD be: brave, skilled, respectful to gods (mostly), and effective in battle.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                        <p class="explanation-text">
                            Diomedes is crucial because he shows us what successful heroism looks like. Unlike Achilles (who withdraws) or Paris (who runs), Diomedes PERFORMS. He fights brilliantly, wins kleos, and—critically—survives. He's the hero the Greek army needs, even if he'll never be as famous as Achilles.

                                Compare this to Achilles' rage-filled speeches in Book 1.

This is mature, effective leadership—something Achilles never manages.

                                Diomedes is like an understudy who performs brilliantly when the lead actor refuses to go on stage. He does EVERYTHING right, wins significant glory, and keeps the show running. But when Achilles returns (Book 19 onwards), everyone forgets about Diomedes. That's his tragedy—being excellent but not legendary.

                            <p>
                                Homer doesn't answer this directly. Achilles gets eternal fame—we're still reading about him 2,800 years later—but dies young and causes enormous suffering. Diomedes survives, goes home, lives a full life—but outside the Iliad, hardly anyone remembers him. Is short life with maximum kleos better than long life with moderate fame? The epic makes you decide.

                            Diomedes proves the Greek army CAN function without Achilles. Not as well—they're still losing ground by Books 8-9—but they haven't collapsed. This undermines Achilles' assumption that Greeks are helpless without him. When Achilles refuses the Book 9 embassy, he's partly wrong: they're struggling but surviving.

                                Diomedes represents the good soldier: brave, effective, team-oriented, sensible. But "good soldier" doesn't become legendary.

                                Book 6 is HECTOR'S book. After five books of almost non-stop battle, Homer pauses to show us what warriors are fighting FOR. Hector leaves the battlefield, enters Troy, and interacts with his mother Hecuba, his brother Paris, Helen, and finally—in the most famous scene in these books—his wife Andromache and baby son Astyanax.

                            We met Hector in Book 3 criticising Paris. Book 6 deepens his character exponentially. We see him as son, brother, husband, and father. We see what he's defending—and what he'll lose. This makes his eventual death in Book 22 devastating, because WE'VE BEEN TO HIS HOME. We know what dies with him.

                                Hector isn't choosing glory OVER Andromache—he's choosing the only option his society allows. If he hides, he's dishonoured, worthless, despised—and still loses Troy eventually. At least fighting preserves his identity and gives Troy a chance. There IS no good choice. Only different ways of losing.

His father and lady mother laughed aloud to see him, and at once the illustrious Hector took the helmet off his head and laid the glittering thing on the ground. Then he kissed his son, dandled him in his arms, and prayed to Zeus and the other gods...

NONE of this happens. Astyanax dies as infant when Greeks conquer Troy. Hector's prayer, his hopes, his genetic legacy—all destroyed. That silence—Homer not telling us the prayer—makes it more painful.

We've been in his home, met his family, watched him hold his baby. When he dies in Book 22, we don't just lose "Troy's defender"—we lose Andromache's husband and Astyanax's father. Book 6 makes Book 22 unbearable. That's Homer's genius.

                            <p>
                                Andromache isn't just emotional—she's STRATEGIC. Her plan might actually work (defensive warfare favours Troy). But Hector can't accept it because hiding behind walls while others fight would destroy his honour. She has the INTELLIGENCE to see the solution and the POWERLESSNESS to implement it. That combination is agonising.

                            In an epic ABOUT war, Andromache is the clearest anti-war voice. She sees through the heroic code's glory to its human cost.

                                The Iliad is about warriors winning kleos through battle. Andromache shows us the OTHER side: families destroyed, women enslaved, children murdered, cities sacked. She's Homer's reminder that for every hero's glorious aristeia, there are dozens of Andromaches losing everything. War creates kleos for men and devastation for everyone else.

                                Heroes die and get eternal kleos. Hector's death is glorious (in heroic terms). But Andromache SURVIVES—and survival means witnessing everything she fears: Hector's death, her son's murder, enslavement, rape, exile. Homer shows that sometimes the survivors suffer most. Death ends suffering; living through loss continues it.

Hector is a DEFENDER—fighting for his actual home. If he dies, his family, city, and civilisation fall with him. Same heroic code, completely different stakes.

                                Hector and Andromache love each other genuinely. They want the same thing (to stay together). But the heroic code makes their desires incompatible. HE must fight to be honourable; SHE needs him to survive to avoid enslavement. The system destroys them both. Homer shows that even "good" characters in "justified" wars still suffer terribly.

This validates Achilles' withdrawal strategy: the Greeks genuinely NEED him specifically, not just "a great warrior." Being excellent isn't the same as being essential.

                                Is Homer criticising the heroic code by showing Andromache's suffering? Or just depicting reality? Scholars debate. What's clear: Homer SHOWS us both perspectives—warriors seeking glory AND families destroyed by that quest. He doesn't tell us which matters more, but he makes us FEEL both. That's more powerful than simple condemnation.

                            <p>
                                "Book 6's farewell scene encapsulates the Iliad's central tragedy: the heroic code's requirements destroy the very things heroes fight to protect. Andromache makes a reasoned, strategic plea—'concentrate the army by the fig-tree, where the wall can be most easily scaled'—demonstrating military intelligence and offering tactical alternatives to open-field combat. Yet Hector cannot accept her logic: 'if I hid myself like a coward and refused to fight, I could never face the Trojans.' His rejection stems not from disagreement but from social impossibility—the heroic code offers no mechanism for prioritising family over honour. Homer deepens the tragedy by making Hector AWARE of consequences: 'the day will come when holy Ilium shall be no more'—he knows Troy will fall and fights anyway. The scene's power derives from mutual awareness and mutual powerlessness: both understand the outcome (Hector's death, Andromache's enslavement, Astyanax's murder), both want to prevent it, neither can change the system that demands it. Through this couple, Homer reveals that the heroic code victimises not just enemies but the heroes themselves and everyone they love."

By Book 6's end, we understand ALL perspectives—Greeks, Trojans, warriors, families. This makes everything that follows (Patroclus's death, Achilles' return, Hector's death) emotionally devastating because we CARE about everyone involved.
