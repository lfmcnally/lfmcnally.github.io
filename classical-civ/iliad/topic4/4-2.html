                        <h3>The Most Controversial Book of the Iliad</h3>
                        
                        <p class="explanation-text">
                            Book 10—the Doloneia (named after Dolon, the Trojan scout)—is WEIRD. It's a night raid, a spy thriller, almost a separate story inserted into the epic. Some ancient scholars thought it wasn't written by Homer at all. It has a different tone, different vocabulary, and feels more like an adventure story than the rest of the Iliad.
                        </p>

                        <p class="explanation-text">
                            But here's why it matters: after Book 9's philosophical debate about heroism, Book 10 gives us heroism as DIRTY WORK. Odysseus and Diomedes sneak through the night, interrogate a prisoner, then murder sleeping men and steal horses. This isn't glorious aristeia—it's brutal pragmatism. War isn't just battlefield courage; it's also cunning, cruelty, and doing whatever it takes to win.

                                Many scholars argue Book 10 is a later addition to the Iliad. The language is unusual, it can be removed without affecting the plot, and ancient sources debated its authenticity. However, for A-Level, treat it as part of the epic and focus on what it CONTRIBUTES thematically, regardless of authorship debates.

It had a felt lining.

                            Odysseus and Diomedes ride back on Rhesus's white horses—the most beautiful horses in the Trojan camp, now Greek prizes. They stop to collect Dolon's armour (remember, they hid it earlier), then return to their waiting comrades.

                                Their friends welcomed them gladly and congratulated them. Nestor the Gerenian charioteer was the first to question them: 'Come, Odysseus, great glory of the Greeks, tell me, how did you capture these horses? Did you go down into the Trojan camp, or did some god meet you and give them to you?'

When they had bathed and rubbed themselves with olive oil, they sat down at table and drawing wine from a full mixing-bowl, they poured a libation to Athene.

                                Ancient scholars (Alexandrian critics) questioned whether Book 10 was written by Homer. Modern scholars note unusual vocabulary, the fact it can be removed without plot disruption, and its different tone. However, it's been part of the text for over 2,000 years and appears in all manuscripts.

                            <h4>Two Sides of Heroism</h4>
                            <p>
                                Books 9 and 10 work together to give us a COMPLETE picture of what heroism means in the Iliad:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Book 9:</strong> Heroism as honour, glory, public recognition, and philosophical integrity. Achilles questions whether kleos is worth dying for. The heroic code is interrogated and found wanting.</li>
                                <li><strong>Book 10:</strong> Heroism as practical intelligence, ruthless efficiency, and doing whatever it takes to win. Odysseus and Diomedes don't question the code—they just GET THINGS DONE.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                Together, they show that war requires BOTH the philosophical hero (Achilles) and the pragmatic warrior (Odysseus). Both mindsets are necessary. Neither is sufficient alone.
                            </p>
