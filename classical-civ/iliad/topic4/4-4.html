                            Book 9's embassy is a MASTERCLASS in character revelation. Homer gives us four distinct personalities, each with different values, persuasive strategies, and relationships to Achilles. By the end of the book, we understand not just WHAT they want (Achilles to fight), but WHO they are.

                                Character isn't shown through description—it's shown through ACTION and SPEECH. The embassy reveals character through: (1) what each person argues, (2) how they argue it, (3) how Achilles responds to them, and (4) what they value most.

                                This is HUGE. Achilles is singing about heroes—he's become a POET, not just a warrior. He's contemplating kleos from the outside, like a bard at a feast. He's moved from DOING heroism to THINKING ABOUT heroism. No wonder he questions it.

                                Achilles is RIGHT that the heroic code is flawed and exploitative. But his refusal to rejoin the war will lead to Patroclus's death—which proves he CAN'T actually opt out. His principled stand costs him the person he loves most. Homer shows us that being right philosophically doesn't mean your choices won't destroy you.

                                Phoenix is the most sympathetic of the three envoys because he's genuinely TRAPPED. He loves Achilles. He wants the Greeks to win. He can't have both. Odysseus and Ajax can walk away and continue their lives. Phoenix has invested everything in Achilles—if this relationship breaks, he has nothing.

                                Ajax DOES achieve something: Achilles offers to defend HIS OWN ships if Hector reaches them. It's not rejoining the war, but it's movement. Ajax's honesty and friendship appeal create the only crack in Achilles's refusal. If anyone could have succeeded, it would have been Ajax.

                                Ajax represents what NORMAL heroic values look like—no philosophical questioning, no cunning manipulation, just straightforward warrior ethics: fight well, value your friends, accept reasonable compensation, get on with it. He's the baseline against which we measure how far Achilles has moved beyond conventional heroism.

                                Don't just DESCRIBE what characters say—ANALYSE what it reveals. "Odysseus appeals to duty" is description. "Odysseus's emphasis on duty reveals his pragmatic worldview where effectiveness matters more than emotional truth" is analysis. Always ask: what does this choice of argument/language/approach tell us about the character's VALUES?
