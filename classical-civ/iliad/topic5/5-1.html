                        <h3>Why Book 16 Is the Turning Point</h3>
                        
                        <p class="explanation-text">
                            Book 16 is where EVERYTHING changes. Patroclus—Achilles's closest companion—can't bear watching the Greeks suffer anymore. He persuades Achilles to let him fight wearing Achilles's armour. He drives the Trojans back in a spectacular aristeia, kills Zeus's son Sarpedon, and then—ignoring Achilles's warnings—pushes too far. Apollo strips him of his armour, Euphorbus wounds him, and Hector delivers the killing blow.
                        </p>

                        <p class="explanation-text">
                            Patroclus's death is the PIVOT of the entire Iliad. It ends Achilles's withdrawal, redirects his wrath from Agamemnon to Hector, and sets in motion the final tragedy. Without Patroclus's death, Achilles never returns. Without Achilles's return, Hector never dies. This is the book that makes everything that follows inevitable.
                        </p>

                            <div class="key-point-text">
                                Patroclus dies BECAUSE he succeeds. His aristeia is so spectacular that he forgets Achilles's warning to "come back when you have driven them from the ships." He pushes towards Troy itself—and gods and Hector kill him for his presumption. Success breeds overconfidence, overconfidence breeds death.

Then he put on Achilles's body-armour, glittering and starry. Over his shoulder he slung his bronze, silver-riveted sword, then his mighty shield. On his mighty head he placed his well-built helmet with a horsehair crest, the plume nodding frighteningly from the top.

                                Then he took up two powerful spears that fitted his grip. The only weapon of matchless Achilles he did not take was Achilles's long, thick, heavy spear. No Greek could wield this but Achilles, who alone knew how to handle it. It was made from an ash-tree on the top of Mount Pelion and had been given to Achilles's father Peleus, to bring death to warriors.

As a lion's will to fight overpowers an indomitable wild boar when the fearless pair battle it out in the mountains over a little stream – so Sarpedon lay stretched in front of his chariot and horses, gurgling and clutching at the bloodstained dust.

With its heavy bronze, it rolled clattering under the horses' hooves, and its plume was defiled with blood and dust. The long-shadowed spear, huge, thick and heavy with its head of bronze, was shattered in Patroclus' hands.

This Euphorbus was the best spearman, racer and horseman of his years. He ran back and mingled with the crowd. He did not stay to fight Patroclus, defenceless though he was.
