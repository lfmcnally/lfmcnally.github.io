                        <p class="explanation-text">
                            Book 17 is the aftermath. Patroclus lies dead, stripped of Achilles' armour. Now TWO battles rage simultaneously: one for his corpse (which the Greeks MUST recover for burial) and one for his armour (which Hector claims as the ultimate trophy). This book shows what warriors will do for honour—both personal and communal—and introduces one of the Iliad's most haunting images: Achilles' immortal horses weeping for their fallen master.

                                The fight over Patroclus's body is BRUTAL and seemingly endless. Heroes risk their lives not for strategic advantage but for symbolism—recovering a friend's corpse, denying an enemy glory. Homer shows war at its most futile and most human: men dying over a dead body while the person who loved Patroclus most (Achilles) doesn't even know he's dead yet.

So Menelaus stood over Patroclus.

                            While the fighting continues, Menelaus realizes someone must TELL Achilles. He sends Antilochus—knowing the news will devastate Achilles but MUST be delivered.

                                'Antilochus, run to brilliant Achilles with the news, if indeed you can persuade him to come. Though I doubt it. He has no armour to wear, since brilliant Hector is wearing it himself.'

                            Antilochus leaves. The battle continues. Book 17 ends with the Greeks carrying Patroclus's body back toward the ships—exhausted, bloodied, having lost the armour but saved the corpse.

                                The Greeks WIN (recover the body) but LOSE (Hector has Achilles' armour). This "victory" costs dozens of lives and achieves nothing strategic. It's pure symbolism—the right to bury a friend. That's war's cruelty: fighting and dying over what's already lost.
