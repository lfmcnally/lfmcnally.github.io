                        <p class="explanation-text">
                            Book 22 is the CLIMAX of the Iliad. Everything has been leading to this: Achilles, driven mad with grief and rage, faces Hector, Troy's greatest defender. The entire city watches from the walls. The gods watch from Olympus. And we know—EVERYONE knows—that Hector is going to die.
                        </p>

                        <p class="explanation-text">
                            This isn't a fair fight. Achilles is semi-divine, wears god-forged armour, and is possessed by inhuman fury. Hector is human, isolated, exhausted from battle, and abandoned by the gods. The tragedy isn't that Hector dies—it's HOW he dies. Tricked by Athene. Chased like an animal. Begging for his body to be returned. Denied even that dignity.
                        </p>

                                So the Trojans, munting like fawns, took refuge in the town, cooled their sweat off and drank to quench their thirst, leaning against the fine battlements. But the Greeks, with their shields tilted back on their shoulders, came up to the wall. As for Hector, his fatal destiny pinned him down remorselessly in front of the Scaean Gate.

Homer deliberately slows down the narrative, building unbearable tension.

                                Notice how Homer DELAYS the duel. The pleas, the debate, the chase—all build tension whilst making us care MORE about Hector. By the time he dies, we've seen him as a son, a hero, a frightened human being, and finally a corpse. The delay makes the death MORE tragic, not less.

As a mountain hawk, the fastest thing that flies, swoops easily on a timid dove—the dove flees in front, but the hawk, screeching, rushes close behind in pursuit, his heart driving him to take her—so Achilles in fury flew straight at Hector, and Hector fled in terror.

She spoke again to her lovely-haired maids: 'Come, two of you follow me so I can see what has happened. That was the voice of my honoured mother-in-law I heard. My heart leaps up into my mouth, my limbs are paralysed beneath me. Some evil is surely near for Priam's children.'

When she reached the tower and the crowd of men, she stood on the wall and looked out, and saw him being dragged before the city. The swift horses were dragging him remorselessly towards the hollow ships of the Greeks. Black night enfolded her eyes, and she fell backwards and gasped out her life. She flung far from her head the bright headbands, the frontlet and woven band, and the veil which golden Aphrodite had given her on the day when Hector of the glittering helmet led her from the house of Eetion, having given countless bride-gifts.

So we were both born to the same fate, you in Troy in the house of Priam, I in Thebe under wooded Plakos, in the house of Eetion, who brought me up when I was small—an ill-fated father to an ill-fated child. I wish he had never begotten me. Now you are going to the house of Hades beneath the secret places of the earth, and you leave me in hateful grief, a widow in your house.'

You will bring him no profit, Hector, now you are dead, nor will he bring you any. Even if he escapes from the tearful war with the Greeks, labour and sorrow will always be his hereafter. Others will rob him of his lands. The day that makes a child an orphan cuts him off completely from his friends. He walks with his head bowed, his cheeks wet with tears. In his need the child goes to his father's companions, tugging one by the cloak, another by the tunic. One of them takes pity and holds out a cup for a moment. He wets his lips but does not wet his palate. Then a child with both parents alive drives him from the feast with blows, taunting him with insults: "Get out! Your father does not feast with us!" Then in tears the child comes back to his widowed mother.'

                                This is one of the most heartbreaking passages in all of Homer. Andromache describes her son's future: orphaned, begging at feasts, BULLIED by other children who have fathers, given a sip from a cup out of pity but denied food, driven away with blows. She imagines every humiliating detail. This is what happens to princes when cities fall.
