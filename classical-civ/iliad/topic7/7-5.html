                            Books 22-24 belong to three characters: Hector (whose death dominates Book 22), Priam (whose supplication drives Book 24), and Achilles (whose transformation across all three books completes his character arc). Understanding how Homer presents each character is essential for A-Level essays.

The complexity is what makes them memorable and what gives you rich material for character analysis essays.

                            Book 22 is Hector's book. We watch him wait outside Troy's walls for Achilles, ignore his parents' desperate pleas to come inside, run in terror three times around the city, then finally stand and fight. His death is the emotional climax of the Iliad.

                                Hector fights not because he wants to, but because SHAME won't let him retreat. "I am ashamed before the Trojan men and women"—he's trapped by social expectations and his own sense of honour. Notice he doesn't say "I'm brave" or "I want to fight". He says staying outside is "far better" than facing the shame of retreat. This is courage born from social pressure, not natural fearlessness.

                            Before standing to fight, Hector RUNS. Three times around Troy, with Achilles chasing him. This isn't noble heroism—it's genuine terror. Homer doesn't hide this or make excuses. He shows Hector's fear honestly.

                            Hector's death scene is brutal. Achilles stabs him in the throat, taunts him as he dies, drags his body behind his chariot, and refuses burial. This isn't a "heroic death"—it's murder followed by desecration.

                                With his dying breath, Hector prophesies Achilles' own death: Paris and Apollo will kill him at the Scaean gate. This links Hector's death to Achilles' future—both heroes die young at Troy. The difference is Hector dies defending his city and family; Achilles dies seeking glory. Homer invites us to consider which death is more meaningful.

                                Homer deliberately ends the Iliad with a TROJAN hero's funeral, not Greek victory. This choice honours Hector and acknowledges that the "enemy" deserves respect and proper mourning. It's a statement about shared humanity transcending sides in a conflict. Hector's tragedy—dying young, defending his doomed city, leaving widow and orphan—is presented as worth commemorating.

                            This line captures the horror and courage of what Priam is doing. He ACKNOWLEDGES it—"no other mortal has borne" this degradation. He's kissing the hands that killed multiple sons. He's not pretending this is easy or noble. He's admitting it's the hardest thing imaginable. That honesty is part of what makes the supplication work.

                                Book 1's Chryses failed (Agamemnon refused brutally). Book 9's embassy failed (Achilles wouldn't accept compensation). Priam succeeds because he shows EXTREME vulnerability, appeals to shared humanity ("think of your own father"), and is emotionally honest. He doesn't hide behind dignity or make demands. He simply asks, as one suffering human to another, for mercy. That vulnerability is what breaks through Achilles' rage.

His courage in Book 24 doesn't save him or Troy—it just allows proper mourning for one son. That limited victory is all that's possible.

                                Through Patroclus' death, his own grief and rage, and finally Priam's supplication, Achilles learns that: (1) vengeance doesn't heal grief, (2) desecration dishonours the desecrator not the victim, (3) all mortals share vulnerability to death and loss, (4) compassion matters more than glory, (5) enemies are still human beings deserving dignity. These aren't lessons he could learn through victory or glory—only through suffering and choosing mercy.

                                Homer doesn't tell us. Hector defends his city dutifully but the war is unjust (Paris caused it). Achilles achieves unmatched glory but loses his humanity temporarily. Both die young at Troy. Both leave grieving families. The Iliad presents heroism as COMPLEX and COSTLY, not simply glorious. Don't write essays claiming one is "better"—analyse how they represent different heroic values with different consequences.

                        <p class="explanation-text">
                            Hector, Priam, and Achilles aren't just characters in an ancient poem—they represent enduring questions about courage, grief, mortality, and what it means to be human. Hector shows us duty can be both noble and tragic. Priam shows us love can transcend pride and fear. Achilles shows us that even the greatest heroes must choose between rage and compassion.

                            <p>
                                What makes the Iliad timeless is that these characters feel REAL. Hector's fear, Priam's desperation, Achilles' transformation—these are psychologically honest portraits of human beings under extreme stress. Homer doesn't idealise or simplify. He shows us people making difficult choices, experiencing genuine emotions, and trying to maintain humanity despite war's dehumanising force. That's why we still read this poem 2,800 years later.
