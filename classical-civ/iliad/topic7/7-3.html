                        <h3>Why Book 24 Is the Heart of the Iliad</h3>
                        
                        <p class="explanation-text">
                            Book 24 is where the Iliad ENDS—not with Troy's fall, not with Achilles' death, not with Greek triumph, but with TWO OLD MEN weeping together in a tent at night. An elderly king travels alone through enemy lines to beg the man who killed his son for the corpse back. And that man—Achilles, the monster who dragged Hector's body for eleven days, who threatened to eat him raw—WEEPS with him and gives it back.
                        </p>

                        <p class="explanation-text">
                            This ending shouldn't work. These are ENEMIES. Achilles murdered Hector in front of all Troy. Priam is the king of the city Achilles is trying to destroy. Achilles has spent eleven days ritually desecrating Hector's body every single morning. But for one night, in that tent, they're just two human beings who understand grief, mortality, and loss. And that's how Homer CHOOSES to end the greatest war poem ever written.

                                Even the worst enemies share fundamental human experiences: grief for the dead, fear of mortality, love for family. The Iliad doesn't celebrate war—it MOURNS it. Book 24 shows us that compassion is possible even in the midst of hatred, that humanity persists even after unspeakable violence, that mercy can break through rage.

                                <li><strong>Eleven days of ritual desecration:</strong> Every single morning Achilles drags Hector's corpse three times around Patroclus' tomb—obsessive, mechanical, endless</li>
                                <li><strong>Apollo preserves the body:</strong> Despite the abuse, Hector's corpse stays perfect—divine protection as divine JUDGEMENT of Achilles' behaviour</li>
                                <li><strong>The gods force intervention:</strong> Apollo condemns Achilles publicly; Zeus commands BOTH Achilles and Priam to act</li>
                                <li><strong>Priam's impossible courage:</strong> An elderly man enters the enemy camp ALONE at night, guided only by a god in disguise</li>
                                <li><strong>The kiss:</strong> Priam kisses "the terrible, man-slaughtering hands which had killed many of his sons"—physical contact with his children's killer</li>
                                <li><strong>Achilles' transformation:</strong> From threatening to eat Hector raw (Book 22) to gently returning the washed, anointed body</li>
                                <li><strong>Shared tears:</strong> Killer and victim's father weep together for Hector, Patroclus, and Peleus—recognising their common suffering</li>
                                <li><strong>The philosophy of suffering:</strong> Achilles' speech about the two jars—all mortals suffer, gods don't, there's no justice, only endurance</li>

                                <li><strong>Three laments:</strong> Andromache (widow), Hecuba (mother), Helen (friend)—each mourns Hector from a different perspective, showing the WHOLE man</li>
                                <li><strong>The final line:</strong> "Such was the funeral they held for Hector, tamer of horses"—a Trojan hero honoured, not Greek victory celebrated</li>

                        <p class="explanation-text">
                            Homer COULD have ended with Hector's death in Book 22. That's the CLIMAX—the dramatic peak where Achilles achieves his vengeance. Or he could have shown Troy's fall, the Trojan Horse, Achilles' death, Odysseus' return. His audience KNEW these stories intimately. They were part of the broader Troy myth cycle. But Homer deliberately chooses to end with RECONCILIATION rather than victory, with BURIAL rather than battle, with SHARED HUMANITY rather than martial triumph.

                                <li>Book 1: Chryses (priest, father) comes begging for his daughter Chryseis—Agamemnon refuses brutally, with contempt and threats</li>
                                <li>Book 24: Priam (king, father) comes begging for his son Hector—Achilles accepts graciously, with tears and compassion</li>
                                <li>Book 1: Apollo's plague punishes the Greeks—mass funeral pyres, anonymous dead, communal suffering</li>
                                <li>Book 24: Hector's individual funeral pyre—one hero properly honoured, personal grief acknowledged</li>
                                <li>Book 1: Achilles withdraws from battle in RAGE—"the wrath of Achilles" begins the poem, driving all the tragedy</li>
                                <li>Book 24: Achilles' rage ENDS in compassion—the wrath resolved through shared humanity, understanding mortality</li>
                                <li>Book 1: Agamemnon treats Chryses "like a worthless vagrant"—public humiliation, contempt for suppliants</li>
                                <li>Book 24: Achilles treats Priam with respect and honour—acknowledging his nobility despite being enemies</li>

                            The parallel with Book 1 is DELIBERATE and PROFOUND. The Iliad is structurally a CIRCLE—we return to where we started (a father begging for his child), but EVERYTHING has changed. The supplication that failed catastrophically in Book 1 succeeds movingly in Book 24. Achilles—who was so consumed by rage that he prayed for Greek deaths—has learned something about compassion, about mortality, about what actually matters when facing death.

                                When Priam enters Achilles' tent and clasps his knees, two worlds collide: Greek and Trojan, youth and age, killer and victim's father, warrior and king, vengeance and mercy. The fact that THIS moment—not military victory, not heroic glory, not the sack of Troy, not Achilles' death—is how Homer chooses to end the Iliad tells us what the poem is REALLY about: the human cost of war, the universality of grief, and the fragile but real possibility of compassion even between worst enemies.

                            <p>
                                Homer ends with reconciliation rather than victory because that's what the poem is ABOUT. It's not about WHO WINS. It's about the COST of war—what violence does to human beings, how grief transforms us, whether compassion is possible amongst enemies. Ending with Troy's fall would be triumphalist. Ending with Hector's funeral is tragic. The Iliad mourns war even as it depicts it.

                            Book 24 follows a careful dramatic arc: desecration → divine intervention → preparation → journey → supplication → shared grief → return → funeral. Homer builds towards the central encounter between Priam and Achilles, then shows its aftermath and consequences.

Homer shows us that even when gods intervene, human choices and emotions are what truly matter.

And when he had hauled him three times round the barrow of Menoetius' son, he would rest again in his hut, leaving Hector stretched face down in the dust.

It's a visible sign that Achilles has gone too far, that his grief has turned into something ugly and inhuman. Divine intervention here is moral commentary—the gods are saying "ENOUGH."

                                Achilles cannot heal himself. He's trapped in a cycle of grief and rage that he cannot break alone. The divine intervention that follows—Zeus sending Thetis to command him—is NECESSARY because Achilles has lost the ability to choose healing for himself. Sometimes people need external force to break destructive patterns.

                                Notice that Homer lets Hera make this argument, but he doesn't endorse it. Zeus' response will show that even though Achilles is semi-divine, he's still WRONG.

                                Notice there's no argument, no resistance. When his MOTHER brings him a divine command, Achilles accepts immediately. This isn't the proud, defiant Achilles of Book 9 who rejected the embassy. Something has shifted. Maybe he's exhausted. Maybe he recognises he's gone too far. Maybe he's ready for this to end. The compulsive behaviour can stop now—he has divine permission to let go.

                            As Priam and Idaeus cross the plain in darkness, Hermes comes to them disguised as a young Greek soldier. This disguise is deliberate—Hermes wants to guide them without revealing his divinity until the right moment.

                                They drove the mules and horses briskly through the night until they reached the ford of the fair-flowing Scamander. There Hermes left Olympus and came down to them. He had taken on the appearance of a young prince with the first down on his lip, in the most charming time of his youth.

                                Hermes appears as a beautiful young nobleman—the kind of person who would plausibly be out on patrol but also approachable and trustworthy. "The first down on his lip" suggests late adolescence, the threshold between youth and manhood. This makes him seem HELPFUL rather than threatening, and explains why he'd be alone at night (young warriors do night watches).

                                When they had driven past the great barrow of Ilus, they halted the mules and horses at the river to give them a drink. By now darkness had fallen over the earth. Then the herald noticed Hermes close at hand and said to Priam: 'Think carefully now, son of Dardanus. This calls for caution. I see a man. I have a feeling he will soon tear us limb from limb. Come, let us flee in the chariot, or else clasp his knees and beg him to have mercy on us.'

                                The herald's immediate reaction is FEAR—"he will soon tear us limb from limb". They're deep in enemy territory, at night, vulnerable. Any Greek soldier could kill them for the treasure they're carrying. Idaeus suggests either fleeing or SUPPLICATING—becoming suppliants to this random soldier. The danger is absolutely real.

Have you no fear of the Greeks who breathe fury, your wicked enemies who are close at hand?

                                Hermes asks questions that highlight the DANGER and ABSURDITY of what Priam is doing: travelling at night, carrying treasure, in enemy territory, as an elderly man. These are the same objections Hecuba made. By voicing them, Hermes is testing Priam's resolve and making him articulate his divine mission.

It is true that Achilles drags him round his dear companion's tomb without mercy when bright dawn appears. But he does him no disfigurement.

                                Homer compares Priam to a FUGITIVE MURDERER seeking asylum—someone who's crossed all boundaries, broken all rules, arrived where he shouldn't be. Just as people are amazed to see a killer seeking refuge in their house, Achilles and his men are amazed to see the Trojan king in their hut. Both situations involve someone vulnerable throwing themselves on another's mercy after the worst has happened.

The gentleness of that push shows Achilles recognising Priam's humanity and nobility.

And he spoke to him with winged words: 'Ah, you have indeed endured much sorrow in your heart. How did you dare to come alone to the Greek ships, into the sight of the man who has killed so many of your brave sons? Your heart must be made of iron.'

Yet this mortality is also what makes human choices, courage, and compassion MEANINGFUL.

Some mortals get more suffering than others, but EVERYONE suffers. The only response is ENDURANCE: "Bear up, and do not mourn unceasingly". Not because mourning is wrong, but because it won't change anything. "You will not bring him back to life."

                                Achilles' philosophy is BLEAK: there's no justice, gods don't care about fairness, suffering is random, mourning doesn't help, and more evil is always coming. Yet somehow it IS comforting—because it's TRUE, because Achilles is saying "we're both victims of the same system", because acknowledging that life is hard makes the burden shared. They can't change their fates, but they can choose how they bear them.

                                Sharing food in ancient Greece created obligation and connection. By eating together, Achilles and Priam have entered into xenia (guest-friendship)—a sacred bond that requires hospitality and protection. Achilles cannot harm someone who has eaten at his table; Priam cannot betray someone who has shown him hospitality. The meal transforms them from enemies into guests and hosts, with all the duties that entails.

                            The final lament comes from Helen—the woman whose abduction caused the war. This is extraordinary: Homer lets the "villain" of the Troy story mourn the Trojan hero she inadvertently destroyed.

This is now the twentieth year since I came away and left my own country. But I never heard from you an ugly or belittling word. And if anyone else in the palace spoke insultingly to me, any of your brothers or sisters or your brothers' fair-robed wives, or your mother—your father was always kind to me like a gentle father—you would stop them with your gentleness and kind words.'

                            <p>
                                Helen is the OUTSIDER in Troy—the Greek woman who "betrayed" Greece (in their eyes), blamed for the war, resented by the Trojans. She must have faced constant hostility. But Hector NEVER insulted her, and actively defended her when others did. "I never heard from you an ugly or belittling word"—in a city full of people who had every reason to hate her, Hector showed her consistent kindness and respect.

                                "They all shudder at me"—Helen is ALONE now. Hector was her only friend in Troy, the only one who treated her with kindness. His death means she's completely isolated amongst people who blame her for everything. This lament shows Hector's HUMANITY—he saw past Helen's reputation to her loneliness and showed compassion to someone everyone else condemned.

Together they create a COMPLETE picture: Hector as family man, as divinely favoured hero, as kind human being who showed mercy to the friendless. He's not just "the enemy Achilles killed"—he's a full person, mourned by many, irreplaceable.

When they had all assembled and come together, first they quenched the pyre with flaming wine, all of it that the fire's strength had reached. Then his brothers and companions gathered his white bones, mourning, and big tears rolled down their cheeks. They took the bones and placed them in a golden urn, covering them with soft purple cloths. They quickly placed the urn in a hollow grave and piled on it a heap of large close-set stones. Hastily they heaped up the burial mound, with lookouts posted all around in case the bronze-clad Greeks should attack before the time.

Day 12: Funeral feast. This follows proper Greek/Trojan burial customs—the soul cannot rest until the body is properly cremated and buried. The "golden urn" and "purple cloths" show royal honours.

                                "Such was the funeral they held for Hector, tamer of horses." THIS is how Homer chooses to end the greatest war epic ever written. Not with Greek victory. Not with Achilles triumphant. Not with Troy falling. With a FUNERAL for a TROJAN hero, properly honoured, properly mourned. The epithet "tamer of horses" reminds us of Hector's nobility, his skill, his heroic qualities. The Iliad ends with GRIEF and RESPECT, not triumph.

                                We must remember: the war CONTINUES after Book 24. The truce expires. Troy will fall. Priam will be murdered. Astyanax will be thrown from the walls. Andromache will be enslaved. Achilles will die. The funeral feast happens in the shadow of inevitable catastrophe. Homer's ending doesn't pretend otherwise—it just says that even in the midst of ongoing war, moments of humanity, mercy, and proper respect for the dead matter. They don't stop the war, but they're not meaningless.

                            <p>
                                The best essays acknowledge BOTH readings. Yes, Achilles shows compassion and the scene is genuinely moving. BUT it's also true that Zeus commands him, the war continues, and Troy will fall. Homer presents the supplication as both triumphant (humans CAN show mercy) and tragic (but it doesn't stop war). This complexity—holding both truths simultaneously—is what makes the Iliad great literature.

                        <h3>Final Thoughts: Why Book 24 Is the Perfect Ending</h3>
                        
                        <p class="explanation-text">
                            Book 24 ends the Iliad not with the fall of Troy, not with Achilles' death, not with any of the famous events we know are coming. Instead, it ends with two old men—enemies, killer and victim's father—weeping together in a tent at night. It ends with a meal shared between people who should hate each other. It ends with a Trojan hero properly buried with Greek consent.
                        </p>

                        <p class="explanation-text">
                            This ending WORKS because it's about something deeper than who wins the war. It's about what WAR DOES to human beings. It's about whether compassion is possible even in the worst circumstances. It's about the universal experiences—grief, mortality, love for family—that transcend sides in a conflict.
                        </p>

                        <p class="explanation-text">
                            Homer could have written triumphalist war poetry celebrating Greek victory. Instead, he wrote a poem that MOURNS war whilst depicting it, that shows us the humanity of both sides, that ends not with triumph but with burial and tears. The Iliad doesn't ask "who will win?" but "what is the cost?" And the answer—shown in every death, every lament, every father losing a son—is that war costs EVERYTHING.

                            <h4>✨ The Lasting Image</h4>
                            <p>
                                When you finish reading the Iliad, the image that stays with you isn't Achilles victorious in battle. It's Achilles and Priam weeping together. It's Priam kissing the hands that killed his sons. It's "they had taken their fill of gazing at one another"—two enemies recognising each other's humanity. It's the final line: "Such was the funeral they held for Hector, tamer of horses." Homer's genius is in THIS choice—to end with compassion rather than conquest, with shared grief rather than glory, with a Trojan funeral rather than a Greek celebration. THAT'S what makes the Iliad timeless.
