                            Book 3 is fascinating because it takes us BACK to the beginning of the war. After Books 1-2 showed us the Greek camp in crisis, Book 3 finally introduces the people the war is actually about: <strong>Helen, Paris, and the duel that could have ended everything.</strong>
                        </p>

                            <p class="info-text" style="color: #1e3a8a;">
                                Paris and Menelaus agree to a duel: winner gets Helen, war over. This is literally what the war was fought for. But the gods won't let it end. Book 3 shows us the war that COULD have been avoided‚Äîif the gods didn't have their own agendas.

                                Homer uses a <strong>snake simile</strong>‚ÄîParis recoils like someone who's seen a dangerous snake. This is ironic: snakes are what you flee from, but Paris CAUSED this war. He treats himself as the victim when he's actually the aggressor.

                                Iris fetches Helen to the walls. Priam asks her to identify Greek heroes. Helen points out Agamemnon, Odysseus, and Ajax. She looks for her brothers but can't find them‚Äîthey're already dead, though she doesn't know this.

                                This is the <strong>tenth year</strong> of the war. Priam should already know who these heroes are! Homer includes this scene to introduce US (the audience) to the Greek heroes through Helen's perspective.

                                Menelaus completely dominates the duel and should win easily. But <strong>Aphrodite's intervention</strong> shows that divine favouritism trumps human justice. The war continues not because of human decisions but because the gods won't let it end.

                            <p style="color: #4b5563; line-height: 1.6;">
                                After saving Paris, Aphrodite goes to fetch Helen. Helen doesn't want to go‚Äîshe knows Paris just lost and it would be shameful. So Aphrodite threatens her: if Helen doesn't obey, Aphrodite will make everyone hate her. Helen has no choice‚Äîshe goes to Paris's bedroom. There, she expresses contempt for his cowardice, but Paris just wants sex and ignores her criticism.

                            <p class="info-text" style="color: #1e3a8a; margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">
                                This scene reveals how divine power actually works in Homer. Gods don't respect free will‚Äîthey compel obedience through threats. Helen is intelligent and self-aware, but she's powerless against divine coercion.
                            </p>
                            <p class="info-text" style="color: #1e3a8a;">
                                It also shows the fundamental incompatibility between Helen and Paris. She despises his cowardice; he only cares about pleasure. Yet they're bound together by Aphrodite's power.

                                This is naked divine coercion. Aphrodite threatens to make EVERYONE hate Helen if she doesn't obey. Helen is already suffering‚ÄîAphrodite's threat is to make her suffering total. Helen has no choice. Divine power = compulsion, not persuasion.

Paris prioritises sex over honour and ignores Helen's contempt. The scene reinforces that Helen is <strong>trapped</strong>‚Äîby divine power, by reputation, by circumstances beyond her control.
