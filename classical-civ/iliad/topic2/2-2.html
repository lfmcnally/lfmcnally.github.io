                            Book 3 is the FIRST TIME we see Paris and Helen properly - and it completely changes how we understand the war. This isn't some noble conflict between heroes. It's caused by a coward who hides behind his beauty and a goddess's protection.

                                The duel between Menelaus and Paris SHOULD end the war. Instead, divine intervention ruins everything and the war continues for YEARS because Aphrodite can't let her favourite lose.

                                Paris chose BEAUTY over POWER or WISDOM. This tells you everything about his character - and explains why Aphrodite will never let him die in Book 3. She owes him.

                                The war isn't JUST about one woman - it's about HONOUR and OATHS. The Greeks can't back down without breaking sacred vows. This is why the duel in Book 3 is so significant - it offers an honourable way out.

                                This is the ONLY time in the Iliad where Helen actively resists. She says NO to the goddess who controls her fate. For one brief moment, she has agency. And then Aphrodite crushes it.

                                "Helen was terrified" - these three words sum up her entire situation. She tried to resist. She had valid reasons (Paris lost, it's shameful, she's suffered enough). But when a goddess threatens you, you OBEY. The "silvery mantle" and "in silence" show her submission - she goes, but with dignity. "Unobserved by the Trojan women" = at least she's spared public humiliation.
