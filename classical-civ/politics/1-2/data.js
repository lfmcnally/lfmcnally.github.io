                    <p>The <span class="key-term" data-definition="quaestor">quaestorship</span> was the essential first step in a senatorial career. Twenty quaestors were elected annually to manage Rome's finances and support senior magistrates.</p>
                    <p><strong>Responsibilities:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Treasury management in Rome (<em>quaestores urbani</em>)</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Automatic Senate membership followed the quaestorship, making it the gateway to aristocratic political life. This created a clear distinction between those who had "entered the Senate" and ordinary citizens.</p>

        definition: 'Ex-praetor governing a province with extended imperium.',
        context: 'The propraetorian system allowed Rome to govern its expanding territories without creating more magistracies. It also provided opportunities for enrichment that became increasingly controversial.'

// Figures Data
const figures = {
    'caesar': {
        name: 'Gaius Julius Caesar',
        dates: '100-44 BC',
        role: 'General, politician, dictator',
        significance: 'Used popularis tactics and military success to gain unprecedented power. His manipulation of Republican institutions and eventual dictatorship destroyed the constitutional system and paved the way for the Empire.'
    },
    'marius': {
        name: 'Gaius Marius',
        dates: 'c. 157-86 BC',
        role: 'General and politician',
        significance: 'Held seven consulships, breaking all precedent for annual tenure. His military reforms and political methods set dangerous precedents for later strongmen like Sulla and Caesar.'
    },
    'sulla': {
        name: 'Lucius Cornelius Sulla',
        dates: '138-78 BC',
        role: 'General and dictator',
        significance: 'Used dictatorship to restructure the Roman constitution in favour of the Senate. His proscriptions and constitutional changes demonstrated how Republican institutions could be manipulated by ambitious individuals.'
    },
    'pompey': {
        name: 'Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus',
        dates: '106-48 BC',
        role: 'General and politician',
        significance: 'Received extraordinary commands that bypassed normal constitutional limits. His career showed how military success could override traditional political constraints, setting precedents exploited by Caesar.'
    },
    'polybius': {
        name: 'Polybius',
        dates: 'c. 200-118 BC',
        role: 'Greek historian and political theorist',
        significance: 'Provided the most detailed ancient analysis of the Roman constitution. His theory of "mixed government" influenced later political thought and helps modern understanding of Republican institutions.'
    },
    'cato-elder': {
        name: 'Marcus Porcius Cato (the Elder)',
        dates: '234-149 BC',
        role: 'Politician and moralist',
        significance: 'As censor, enforced traditional Roman values and resisted Greek cultural influence. His rigid morality and famous phrase "Carthage must be destroyed" embodied conservative Republican ideals.'
    },
    'tiberius-gracchus': {
        name: 'Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus',
        dates: '168-133 BC',
        role: 'Tribune and reformer',
        significance: 'Used tribunician power to push land redistribution against senatorial opposition. His assassination marked the beginning of political violence in the Late Republic and demonstrated how reform could destabilise the system.'
    },
    'clodius': {
        name: 'Publius Clodius Pulcher',
        dates: 'c. 93-52 BC',
        role: 'Tribune and popularis politician',
        significance: 'Used tribunician power and organised violence to dominate Roman politics. His methods showed how Republican institutions could be weaponised for personal advantage and political disruption.'

    'bibulus': {
        name: 'Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus',
        dates: 'c. 102-48 BC',
        role: 'Consul and optimate politician',
        significance: 'As Caesar\'s consular colleague in 59 BC, attempted to block Caesar\'s legislation through constitutional means. His failure demonstrated the inadequacy of traditional checks against determined opposition.'
    }
};

// Concepts Data
const concepts = {
    'collegiality': {
        concept: 'Collegiality',
        explanation: 'The principle that most Roman magistracies were shared between two or more individuals, preventing concentration of power.',
        importance: 'Fundamental safeguard against autocracy. Each magistrate could veto his colleague\'s actions, ensuring deliberation and preventing hasty decisions. However, it could also create paralysis when colleagues disagreed.'
    },
    'annual-tenure': {
        concept: 'Annual Tenure',
        explanation: 'Most Roman magistracies lasted only one year, preventing the entrenchment of power and ensuring regular turnover.',
        importance: 'Prevented individuals from building permanent power bases in office. Combined with collegiality, it distributed authority across many people over time. Ambitious politicians like Marius and Caesar violated this principle to devastating effect.'
    },
    'imperium': {
        concept: 'Imperium',
        explanation: 'Supreme command authority held by senior magistrates, including military command and judicial power.',
        importance: 'Distinguished senior magistrates (consuls, praetors) from junior ones. Imperium provided the authority necessary for military leadership and crisis management, but its concentration made it dangerous if misused.'
    },
    'auctoritas': {
        concept: 'Auctoritas',
        explanation: 'Moral authority and influence based on experience, wisdom, and past service rather than formal legal power.',
        importance: 'The Senate\'s influence depended on auctoritas rather than legal authority. This informal power could be very effective but was vulnerable to challenge by those willing to ignore tradition and precedent.'
    },
    'intercessio': {
        concept: 'Intercessio',
        explanation: 'The power of veto held by tribunes and other magistrates, allowing them to halt official actions.',
        importance: 'Key check on magisterial power. Tribunes could veto any action, while magistrates of equal rank could block colleagues. This power could protect citizens but also paralyse government if misused.'
    },
    'sacrosanctitas': {
        concept: 'Sacrosanctitas',
        explanation: 'The physical inviolability of tribunes, making it a religious crime to harm them.',
        importance: 'Protected tribunes from retaliation for using their veto power. This religious protection was essential for their role as popular champions, but it also made them untouchable when they abused their position.'
    },
    'provocatio': {
        concept: 'Provocatio',
        explanation: 'The right of Roman citizens to appeal magistrates\' decisions to the popular assemblies.',
        importance: 'Fundamental protection against arbitrary punishment. Citizens within Rome could appeal death sentences or severe punishment, limiting magisterial power and ensuring some measure of due process.'
    },
    'mos-maiorum': {
        concept: 'Mos Maiorum',
        explanation: 'The "customs of the ancestors" - traditional practices that guided Roman behaviour despite lacking legal force.',
        importance: 'Much of the Roman constitution depended on voluntary adherence to tradition rather than written law. When ambitious politicians abandoned mos maiorum, the informal constraints on power collapsed.'
    },
    'clientela': {
        concept: 'Clientela',
        explanation: 'The system of patron-client relationships that created networks of obligation throughout Roman society.',
        importance: 'Influenced voting patterns and political alliances. Wealthy patrons could mobilise clients\' votes, while ambitious politicians built clientelae through favours and benefits. This undermined genuine democratic participation.'
