                                <li>Resistance to tyranny as moral duty</li>

                    <div class="primary-source">
                        "By this blood—most chaste before the outrage of the prince—I swear, and I call you, gods, to witness, that I will pursue Lucius Tarquinius Superbus and his wicked wife and all his children with sword, with fire, with whatsoever violence I may, and that I will suffer neither them nor any other to be king in Rome!"

                    <h3>SPQR and the Idea of Shared Governance</h3>
                    
                    <h4>The Meaning of SPQR</h4>
                    <p><span class="key-term" data-definition="spqr">SPQR</span> — <em>Senatus Populusque Romanus</em> ("The Senate and the Roman People") — became the official motto of the Roman Republic. More than just an abbreviation, it embodied a political philosophy about shared power and collective authority.</p>

                    <div class="primary-source">
                        "The Republic is the property of the people, but a people is not every assemblage of men, however congregated, but an assemblage united by a common agreement about law and a partnership in utility."
                        <div class="source-citation">— Cicero, <em>De Re Publica</em> 1.39</div>
                    </div>

                    <h4>The Theory of Mixed Government</h4>
                    <p>The Roman Republic attempted to balance different forms of government in what <span class="key-figure" data-info="polybius">Polybius</span> called a "mixed constitution." This system sought to capture the advantages of monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy while avoiding their respective dangers:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Monarchical element:</strong> Consuls provided executive leadership and military command</li>
                        <li><strong>Aristocratic element:</strong> The Senate offered experienced guidance and continuity</li>
                        <li><strong>Democratic element:</strong> Popular assemblies allowed citizen participation in legislation and elections</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="primary-source">
                        "The best political system is a blend of all three—monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy."
                        <div class="source-citation">— Polybius, <em>Histories</em> 6.3</div>
                    </div>

                    <h4>The Reality of Power</h4>
                    <p>While <em>SPQR</em> suggested partnership between Senate and People, the reality was more complex. The <span class="key-concept" data-concept="patricians">patricians</span> (aristocratic families) initially monopolised political power, while the <span class="key-concept" data-concept="plebeians">plebeians</span> (common citizens) had to fight for political rights through a series of conflicts known as the <span class="key-concept" data-concept="struggle-orders">Struggle of the Orders</span>.</p>

                    <p>Nevertheless, the <em>theoretical</em> equality embedded in SPQR created a powerful ideal that politicians would invoke throughout Republican history—and which autocrats like <span class="key-figure" data-info="julius-caesar">Caesar</span> and <span class="key-figure" data-info="augustus">Augustus</span> would need to respect, at least in form.</p>

                    <h4>Republican Values and Identity</h4>
                    <p>The transition from monarchy to republic established core values that shaped Roman political culture:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong><span class="key-concept" data-concept="libertas">Libertas</span>:</strong> Freedom from tyrannical domination</li>
                        <li><strong><span class="key-concept" data-concept="virtus">Virtus</span>:</strong> Masculine courage and civic excellence</li>
                        <li><strong><span class="key-concept" data-concept="dignitas">Dignitas</span>:</strong> Personal honour and public standing</li>
                        <li><strong><span class="key-concept" data-concept="pietas">Pietas</span>:</strong> Duty to gods, family, and state</li>
                        <li><strong><span class="key-concept" data-concept="gravitas">Gravitas</span>:</strong> Serious-minded responsibility</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>These values, rooted in the Republic's foundation story, provided the moral framework within which Roman politicians operated—or claimed to operate—for the next 500 years.</p>

                    significance: 'Led the revolt against Tarquinius Superbus and became one of the first two consuls. His oath over Lucretia\'s body established the foundational principle of Republican libertas. His descendants, including Marcus Brutus, would later claim to inherit his legacy.'

                    significance: 'Her rape by Sextus Tarquinius and subsequent suicide became the catalyst for the Roman Republic. She embodied the ideal of pudicitia (chastity) and her sacrifice represented the rejection of tyrannical abuse of power.'

                    significance: 'His analysis of the Roman constitution as a "mixed government" influenced later political thought. As a Greek hostage in Rome, he provided an outsider\'s perspective on Republican institutions and their effectiveness.'

                    significance: 'As divine father of Rome\'s founder, Mars gave Romans a warrior identity and divine protection. His children founding Rome linked the city\'s destiny to military success and justified Roman conquest.'

                    significance: 'As divine mother of Aeneas, Venus gave the Julian family (and later Caesar and Augustus) claims to divine ancestry. Her protection of Aeneas demonstrated divine favour for Rome\'s mission.'
