                            "He was the first king to break the custom handed down by his predecessors of consulting the Senate on all matters; he governed by his own counsel alone."

                        <p>This transformation from monarchical to republican values shaped Roman political culture for centuries. However, the Late Republic would see ambitious individuals attempting to restore monarchical power whilst claiming to defend republican traditions.</p>

                        <h3>Republican Values and Identity</h3>
                
                        <h4>The Theory of Mixed Government</h4>
                        <p>The Roman Republic attempted to balance different forms of government in what <span class="key-figure" data-info="polybius">Polybius</span> called a "mixed constitution." This system sought to capture the advantages of monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy whilst avoiding their respective dangers:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Monarchical element:</strong> Consuls provided executive leadership and military command</li>
                            <li><strong>Aristocratic element:</strong> The Senate offered experienced guidance and continuity</li>
                            <li><strong>Democratic element:</strong> Popular assemblies allowed citizen participation in legislation and elections</li>
                        </ul>

                        <div class="primary-source">
                            "The best political system is a blend of all three‚Äîmonarchy, aristocracy, and democracy."
                            <div class="source-citation">‚Äî Polybius, <em>Histories</em> 6.3</div>
                        </div>

                        <h4>The Reality of Power</h4>
                        <p>Whilst <em>SPQR</em> suggested partnership between Senate and People, the reality was more complex. The <span class="key-concept" data-concept="patricians">patricians</span> (aristocratic families) initially monopolised political power, whilst the <span class="key-concept" data-concept="plebeians">plebeians</span> (common citizens) had to fight for political rights through a series of conflicts known as the <span class="key-concept" data-concept="struggle-orders">Struggle of the Orders</span>.</p>

                        <p>Nevertheless, the <em>theoretical</em> equality embedded in SPQR created a powerful ideal that politicians would invoke throughout Republican history‚Äîand which autocrats like <span class="key-figure" data-info="julius-caesar">Caesar</span> and <span class="key-figure" data-info="augustus">Augustus</span> would need to respect, at least in form.</p>

                    <p>Thank you for checking out Classicalia! I'm Lawrence and I teach Latin and Classics in Bristol.</p>
                    
                    <p>I have a BA in Ancient History from King's College London, a PGCE in Latin with Classics from the University of Cambridge and an MEd (Transforming Practice) from Darwin College, Cambridge. I am particularly interested in Tacitean studies and the history of memory in classical antiquity. In 2021 I won the Classical Association's 'Outstanding New Teacher' award.</p>
                    
                    <p>I also enjoy creating teacher guides and student workbooks. Please feel free to use my resources!</p>
                    
                    <p>If you have any feedback, thoughts or questions, please don't hesitate to get in touch!</p>
