                        <p>According to Roman historians like <span class="key-figure" data-info="livy">Livy</span>, the last Roman king <span class="key-figure" data-info="tarquin-superbus">Lucius Tarquinius Superbus</span> ("the Proud") embodied everything Romans came to despise about monarchy. He ruled without consulting the Senate, used violence to suppress opposition, and accumulated wealth through exploitation.</p>

                        <div class="primary-source">
                            "He was the first king to break the custom handed down by his predecessors of consulting the Senate on all matters; he governed by his own counsel alone."

                        <h4>The Rape of Lucretia: Catalyst for Revolution</h4>
                        <p>The event that triggered the Republic's foundation was deeply personal yet profoundly political. <span class="key-figure" data-info="sextus-tarquinius">Sextus Tarquinius</span>, the king's son, raped <span class="key-figure" data-info="lucretia">Lucretia</span>, the wife of <span class="key-figure" data-info="collatinus">Tarquinius Collatinus</span>. Her response—and the response of the Roman nobles—reveals fundamental Republican values.</p>

                                <p>Her suicide galvanises the Roman nobility, led by <span class="key-figure" data-info="brutus">Lucius Junius Brutus</span>, to swear an oath to expel the Tarquins and never again allow monarchical rule.</p>

                            "By this blood—most chaste before the outrage of the prince—I swear, and I call you, gods, to witness, that I will pursue Lucius Tarquinius Superbus and his wicked wife and all his children with sword, with fire, with whatsoever violence I may, and that I will suffer neither them nor any other to be king in Rome!"

                        <p>This transformation from monarchical to republican values shaped Roman political culture for centuries. However, the Late Republic would see ambitious individuals attempting to restore monarchical power whilst claiming to defend republican traditions.</p>

                        <h3>Republican Values and Identity</h3>
                
                        <h4>The Theory of Mixed Government</h4>
                        <p>The Roman Republic attempted to balance different forms of government in what <span class="key-figure" data-info="polybius">Polybius</span> called a "mixed constitution." This system sought to capture the advantages of monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy whilst avoiding their respective dangers:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Monarchical element:</strong> Consuls provided executive leadership and military command</li>
                            <li><strong>Aristocratic element:</strong> The Senate offered experienced guidance and continuity</li>
                            <li><strong>Democratic element:</strong> Popular assemblies allowed citizen participation in legislation and elections</li>
                        </ul>

                        <div class="primary-source">
                            "The best political system is a blend of all three—monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy."
                            <div class="source-citation">— Polybius, <em>Histories</em> 6.3</div>
                        </div>

                        <h4>The Reality of Power</h4>
                        <p>Whilst <em>SPQR</em> suggested partnership between Senate and People, the reality was more complex. The <span class="key-concept" data-concept="patricians">patricians</span> (aristocratic families) initially monopolised political power, whilst the <span class="key-concept" data-concept="plebeians">plebeians</span> (common citizens) had to fight for political rights through a series of conflicts known as the <span class="key-concept" data-concept="struggle-orders">Struggle of the Orders</span>.</p>

                        <p>Nevertheless, the <em>theoretical</em> equality embedded in SPQR created a powerful ideal that politicians would invoke throughout Republican history—and which autocrats like <span class="key-figure" data-info="julius-caesar">Caesar</span> and <span class="key-figure" data-info="augustus">Augustus</span> would need to respect, at least in form.</p>

                    <p>Thank you for checking out Classicalia! I'm Lawrence and I teach Latin and Classics in Bristol.</p>
                    
                    <p>I have a BA in Ancient History from King's College London, a PGCE in Latin with Classics from the University of Cambridge and an MEd (Transforming Practice) from Darwin College, Cambridge. I am particularly interested in Tacitean studies and the history of memory in classical antiquity. In 2021 I won the Classical Association's 'Outstanding New Teacher' award.</p>
                    
                    <p>I also enjoy creating teacher guides and student workbooks. Please feel free to use my resources!</p>
                    
                    <p>If you have any feedback, thoughts or questions, please don't hesitate to get in touch!</p>
