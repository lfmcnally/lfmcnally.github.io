        context: 'This phrase appeared on standards, buildings, and official documents, representing the ideal of shared governance between the elite Senate and Roman citizens. Whilst often more theoretical than practical, SPQR embodied the Republican rejection of monarchy and the principle that authority came from collective institutions rather than individual rulers.'

        definition: 'The sacred boundary of Rome, marked by stones and ritually established by Romulus.',
        context: 'The pomerium defined the limits of Rome proper and had important religious and legal significance. Weapons could not be carried within it, and certain religious rituals could only be performed outside it. Extending the pomerium required a formal triumph and marked territorial expansion.'

        definition: 'Literally "the public thing" - the Roman state belonging to all citizens, not a single ruler.',
        context: 'This concept embodied the Republican ideal that the state belonged to the people collectively, not to any individual. It contrasted sharply with monarchy, where the state was essentially the king\'s property. The res publica required active citizen participation and shared responsibility.'

        dates: 'Mythical (c. 1180 BC)',
        role: 'Trojan hero, son of Venus',
        significance: 'The legendary founder of the Roman race. His journey from Troy to Italy, told in Virgil\'s Aeneid, provided Romans with a noble origin story connecting them to the heroes of Homer whilst establishing their destined rule over the Mediterranean.'
    },
    'brutus': {
        name: 'Lucius Junius Brutus',
        dates: 'Traditional dates: c. 545-509 BC',
        role: 'Founder of the Roman Republic',
        significance: 'Led the revolt against Tarquinius Superbus and became one of the first two consuls. His oath over Lucretia\'s body established the foundational principle of Republican libertas. His descendants, including Marcus Brutus, would later claim to inherit his legacy.'

        role: 'Roman noblewoman',
        significance: 'Her rape by Sextus Tarquinius and subsequent suicide became the catalyst for the Roman Republic. She embodied the ideal of pudicitia (chastity) and her sacrifice represented the rejection of tyrannical abuse of power.'

        name: 'Titus Livius (Livy)',
        dates: '59 BC - AD 17',
        role: 'Roman historian',
        significance: 'Author of Ab Urbe Condita, a monumental history of Rome from its foundation. His work preserves much of the traditional narrative of early Rome, though written centuries after the events described.'

        significance: 'His tyrannical rule and the crimes of his family led to the overthrow of the monarchy. He became the archetypal tyrant in Roman memory, and fear of his return shaped Republican institutions.'

        explanation: 'Roman freedom - specifically freedom from domination by a single individual (king or tyrant). Unlike modern liberty, it focused on collective political freedom rather than individual rights.',
        importance: 'Central to Republican identity. Politicians across the spectrum claimed to defend libertas, though they defined it differently. Caesar claimed to defend the people\'s libertas from senatorial oppression; his assassins claimed to restore libertas from his dictatorship.'
    },
    'pietas': {
        concept: 'Pietas',
        explanation: 'Duty and devotion to gods, family, and state. Aeneas was famous for his pietas, carrying his father from burning Troy and obeying divine commands.',
        importance: 'Fundamental Roman virtue that balanced individual achievement with social obligation. It justified Roman rule as divinely sanctioned and created expectations of leaders to serve the common good, not just personal ambition.'
    },
    'auctoritas': {
        concept: 'Auctoritas',
        explanation: 'Authority based on prestige, respect, and moral weight rather than legal power. The Senate\'s influence rested primarily on its auctoritas.',
        importance: 'This concept distinguished Roman governance from pure democracy or autocracy. It created a system where tradition and respect mattered as much as formal law, allowing flexibility but also creating tensions when auctoritas and legal power conflicted.'
    },
    'virtus': {
        concept: 'Virtus',
        explanation: 'Masculine courage and excellence, especially in military and civic contexts. Originally meant "manliness" but evolved to encompass broader moral excellence.',
        importance: 'Virtus was the quality that justified political advancement and social status. Competition for recognition of virtus drove Roman expansion but also internal conflict as generals sought opportunities to display their excellence.'
    },
    'gravitas': {
        concept: 'Gravitas',
        explanation: 'Serious-minded dignity and sense of responsibility. The weight of character expected of Roman leaders.',
        importance: 'Gravitas distinguished proper Roman behaviour from Greek "levity" or Eastern "luxury". It was essential for political credibility and helped maintain the Republic\'s conservative character even as it expanded.'
