                <p>When tribune <span class="key-figure" data-info="sulpicius">Sulpicius Rufus</span> transferred the <span class="key-term" data-definition="mithridatic-command">Mithridatic command</span> from Sulla to <span class="key-figure" data-info="marius">Marius</span>, Sulla made the unprecedented decision to march on Rome with six legions.</p>
                
                <p>This violated the most sacred principle of Republican government‚Äîthat armies existed to defend the state, not threaten it. Sulla's violation of the <span class="key-term" data-definition="pomerium">pomerium</span> (the sacred boundary of Rome) with armed troops was both political revolution and religious sacrilege.</p>
                
                <p>The march succeeded because resistance collapsed. Most senators fled the city, Marius lacked military forces in Rome, and urban citizens could not oppose disciplined legions. Sulla's soldiers, recruited through Marius's reforms, followed their commander even against Rome itself‚Äîproving the danger of client armies.</p>

                <p>Having concluded peace with Mithridates (though not complete victory), Sulla returned to Italy in spring 83 BC with five battle-hardened legions and burning desire for vengeance. His landing at <span class="key-term" data-definition="brundisium">Brundisium</span> marked the beginning of the final phase of civil war.</p>
                
                <p>Though outnumbered by Marian forces, Sulla's veterans were disciplined professionals who had campaigned together for years in the east. More importantly, prominent Romans began defecting to his cause, including the young <span class="key-figure" data-info="pompey">Pompey</span> (age 23) who raised three legions in Picenum to support Sulla.</p>
                
                <p>The psychological impact was enormous. Sulla represented legitimacy and order to those exhausted by years of Marian-Cinnan chaos. His propaganda promised constitutional restoration and attracted moderates who had initially opposed him.</p>

                <p>The aftermath was horrific. Sulla ordered the systematic massacre of 6,000+ prisoners in the Villa Publica whilst the Senate met nearby in the Temple of Bellona.

                    <p><strong>Judicial Reforms:</strong> Returned exclusive jury service in the courts (<span class="key-term" data-definition="quaestiones">quaestiones</span>) to senators, reversing Gracchan legislation that had given equestrians judicial power.

                    <p><strong>Failure:</strong> Expansion with political appointees actually weakened traditional senatorial authority and prestige. New senators lacked the expertise and connections of old families. Within a generation, the Senate was widely seen as incompetent and corrupt.</p>

                    <p>Sulla systematically dismantled tribunician authority‚Äîthe office that had launched the careers of the Gracchi, Saturninus, and Sulpicius. His restrictions were designed to make the tribunate powerless and unattractive.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Legislative Ban:</strong> Tribunes were prohibited from proposing legislation to popular assemblies, eliminating their ability to bypass senatorial opposition through direct appeals to the people. This was the tribunes' most powerful weapon‚Äînow removed.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Career Dead-end:</strong> Tribunes were barred from seeking higher magistracies, making the office a terminal position that ambitious politicians would avoid. Previously, successful tribunes could leverage popularity into higher offices.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Veto Retained:</strong> Tribunes kept their traditional veto power, but the legislative ban made this largely irrelevant since they couldn't propose alternative measures.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Intention:</strong> Prevent future popularis politicians from using tribunician power to challenge senatorial authority.</p>

                    <p><strong>Mandatory Intervals:</strong> Required two-year gaps between holding consecutive magistracies, slowing political careers and giving the Senate time to assess candidates.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Office Sequence:</strong> Mandated strict progression‚Äîquaestorship before praetorship, praetorship before consulship. No skipping steps.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Numbers Increased:</strong> Raised annual praetors from 8 to 20, providing more administrative positions for the expanded Senate whilst maintaining only 2 consuls.</p>

                    <p><strong>Intention:</strong> Prevent future Mariuses and Sullas from using armies for political purposes; keep military force subordinate to civilian authority.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Fundamental Flaw:</strong> Sulla's reforms could not address the root problem‚Äîprofessional armies loyal to commanders rather than the state (Marius's legacy). Constitutional law cannot constrain those who control military force.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Failure:</strong> Pompey, Caesar, and others repeatedly violated these restrictions. Caesar's crossing of the Rubicon (49 BC) was illegal under Sullan law, but his veterans followed him anyway. The reforms were unenforceable precisely when they mattered most.</p>

Future civil wars became wars of extermination because compromise meant risking proscription. Approximately 2,000 senators and equestrians died in Sulla\'s proscriptions.'
