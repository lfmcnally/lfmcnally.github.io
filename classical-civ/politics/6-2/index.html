                            Through the Philippics, Cicero aimed to rally the Senate to act against Antony and support what he believed would be a Republican resurgence, guided by the Senate, and perhaps led by <span class="character">Octavian</span>.

                            <h4>Rhetorical Strategy</h4>
                            <p>Cicero's attacks on Antony were not merely political but deeply personal. He depicted Antony as morally corrupt, contrasting him with the traditional Roman virtues that the Senate supposedly embodied. This was classic invective rhetoric, designed to destroy Antony's reputation and isolate him politically.</p>

                            <h4>Political Miscalculation</h4>
                            <p>Cicero's strategy rested on the assumption that Octavian would remain a tool of the Senate rather than become a power in his own right. He famously said of Octavian that the young man should be "praised, honoured, and removed" (<em>laudandum, ornandum, tollendum</em>). This proved to be a fatal miscalculation.</p>

                                The Philippics are excellent sources for understanding Republican ideology and the rhetoric of political crisis. However, they must be read critically as highly partisan documents designed to persuade rather than provide balanced accounts.

                            <span class="character">Cicero's</span> correspondence during this time shows his intense political scheming. In letters to <span class="character">Trebonius</span> and <span class="character">Plancus</span>, two key players in the provinces, he urged coordinated action to oppose Antony.

                            <h4>Trebonius</h4>
                            <p>Gaius Trebonius was one of the conspirators against Caesar and was governing the province of Asia. Cicero wrote to him seeking support for the Republican cause and coordination against Antony's forces. Trebonius would be killed by Dolabella in early 43 BC.</p>

                            <p>Lucius Munatius Plancus governed Transalpine Gaul and commanded significant military forces. Cicero's letters to him reveal attempts to secure his loyalty to the Senate. Plancus, however, would prove to be a political weathervane, eventually siding with Antony.</p>

                        <p class="explanation-text">
                            However, Cicero's optimism often seemed out of step with the realities on the ground. <span class="character">Octavian</span> was clearly building a personal power base, and the Senate remained divided. The letters reveal a man desperately trying to coordinate resistance while the political ground shifted beneath his feet.

                                Cicero's letters provide invaluable insight into the day-to-day political manoeuvring of the late Republic. Unlike his published speeches, they offer more candid assessments of the political situation, though they still reflect his own biases and limited information.

                            Cicero's campaign against Antony would ultimately cost him his life. When Octavian, Antony, and Lepidus formed the Second Triumvirate in late 43 BC, they drew up proscription lists of their enemies. Cicero was high on Antony's list. Despite attempts to flee, he was caught and killed on 7 December 43 BC.

                            His head and hands were displayed on the Rostra in the Forum, the very platform from which he had delivered so many of his famous speeches. It was a brutal end for the Republic's greatest orator and a symbol of how completely the old political order had collapsed.
