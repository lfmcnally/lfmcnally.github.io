1.4 Political Ideals
The Roman Republic was not only a system of institutions but also a set of deeply held values. These ideals shaped how Roman politicians presented themselves, what they claimed to defend, and how they judged their opponents. While often sincerely believed, they could also be used as rhetorical tools to justify ambition and denounce rivals.
Understanding these ideals is key to interpreting the actions and words of figures like Cicero, Cato, Caesar, and others.
Dignitas
Dignitas meant personal worth, honour, and reputation. It was earned through military victories, public service, oratory, and the visible support of the people.
A man’s dignitas was central to his public image.
Losing it — through exile, humiliation, or defeat — was a source of deep shame.
Increasing it often justified ambitious or even illegal acts.
“Dignity is preserved by honourable deeds and public service.” – Cicero
Auctoritas
Auctoritas referred to influence and prestige — a kind of moral weight. It was not the same as legal power (imperium), but could often achieve more. A senator or statesman with great auctoritas could persuade others, sway debates, and dominate decisions.
The Senate as a body claimed collective auctoritas.
Cicero’s auctoritas was built on his reputation as a speaker, statesman, and defender of the Republic.
Libertas
Libertas (freedom) was a central Republican value, often defined in opposition to tyranny. For Romans, liberty meant freedom from domination by one man — especially a king or dictator — and the ability of citizens to take part in public life.
It was used as a justification for opposing figures like Sulla and Caesar.


However, its meaning could be twisted. Caesar claimed to defend the libertas of the people; the conspirators who killed him claimed to be restoring libertas from his dictatorship.
Concordia ordinum
This phrase, coined by Cicero, means “harmony of the orders” — the idea that the senatorial and equestrian classes should cooperate to govern Rome. Cicero saw this alliance as the best hope for preserving Republican order.
It idealised unity and compromise between elite groups.
In reality, tensions between these orders often led to political conflict and violence.
Otium cum dignitate
Literally “leisure with dignity,” this phrase expressed the ideal state of peace where the elite could live a quiet life of reflection, culture, and political stability — with dignity intact.
Cicero used it to describe his vision of a peaceful, hierarchical Republic, governed by the wise and virtuous.
His letters often show a yearning for this state of affairs, especially in later life.
Stoicism and Cato
Roman ideals were also shaped by philosophical influence, particularly Stoicism. Cato the Younger embodied this philosophy in his politics:
Belief in duty, reason, and virtue above personal gain
Refusal to compromise principles, even in the face of defeat
Willingness to die rather than live under a tyrant (his suicide in 46 BC)
Cato became a symbol of Republican resistance to Caesar and of an unbending commitment to virtue — though critics saw him as stubborn and politically inflexible.
Cynicism and Political Realism
Not all figures believed in, or acted by, these ideals. Figures like Caesar and Clodius could be seen as manipulators of tradition, cloaking ambition in traditional rhetoric. Some scholars argue that ideals such as libertas and dignitas were often invoked hypocritically — to preserve elite control or justify personal ambition.
“In a corrupt Republic, even virtues become weapons.” – Sallust
