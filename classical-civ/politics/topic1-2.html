                            <h4>Quaestor: Gateway to Political Power</h4>
                            <p>The <span class="key-term" data-definition="quaestor">quaestorship</span> was the essential first step in a senatorial career. Twenty quaestors were elected annually to manage Rome's finances and support senior magistrates.</p>
                            <p><strong>Responsibilities:</strong></p>
                            <ul>

                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Automatic Senate membership followed the quaestorship, making it the gateway to aristocratic political life. This created a clear distinction between those who had "entered the Senate" and ordinary citizens.</p>

Four aediles managed Rome's urban infrastructure and public entertainment, offering opportunities to win popular favour through generous spending.</p>
                            <p><strong>Responsibilities:</strong></p>

                            <p><strong>Political significance:</strong> Ambitious politicians spent vast personal fortunes on games and public works during their aedileship to build name recognition. <span class="key-figure" data-info="caesar">Caesar</span> bankrupted himself with spectacular games that helped launch his later career.</p>

                            <p><strong>Military and provincial role:</strong> After their year in Rome, praetors typically governed provinces as <span class="key-term" data-definition="propraetor">propraetors</span>, commanding armies and administering justice.

                                <p><strong>Composition and membership:</strong> Senators held their positions for life (unless removed by censors) and were arranged by precedence based on the highest office held.

                                <p><strong>Organisation and voting:</strong> Citizens were arranged in 193 centuries, with the wealthiest (<span class="key-term" data-definition="equites">equites</span> and first class) controlling 98 centuries—a majority.

                    <h4>Checks and Balances: Preventing Autocracy</h4>
                    <p>The Republican constitution aimed to prevent any individual from gaining monarchical power through several mechanisms:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong><span class="key-concept" data-concept="collegiality">Collegiality</span>:</strong> Most offices were shared, allowing colleagues to check each other</li>
                        <li><strong><span class="key-concept" data-concept="annual-tenure">Annual tenure</span>:</strong> Short terms prevented entrenchment of power</li>
                        <li><strong><span class="key-concept" data-concept="provocatio">Provocatio</span>:</strong> Citizens could appeal magistrates' decisions</li>
                        <li><strong>Separation of powers:</strong> Different assemblies, Senate, and magistrates balanced each other</li>
                        <li><strong>Religious constraints:</strong> Auspices and omens could halt political action</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="primary-source">
                        "The Republic's safety lies in the limitation of power."
                        <div class="source-citation">— Cicero, <em>De Re Publica</em> 2.43</div>
                    </div>

                    <h4>When the System Broke Down</h4>
                    <p>By the Late Republic, ambitious individuals had learned to manipulate these safeguards:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong><span class="key-figure" data-info="marius">Marius</span>:</strong> Held seven consulships, breaking precedent</li>
                        <li><strong><span class="key-figure" data-info="sulla">Sulla</span>:</strong> Used dictatorship to restructure the constitution</li>
                        <li><strong><span class="key-figure" data-info="pompey">Pompey</span>:</strong> Received extraordinary commands outside normal rules</li>
                        <li><strong><span class="key-figure" data-info="caesar">Caesar</span>:</strong> Bypassed collegiality, extended commands, and ultimately destroyed the system</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>These violations of constitutional norms demonstrated that Republican institutions depended on voluntary compliance with tradition—what the Romans called <span class="key-concept" data-concept="mos-maiorum">mos maiorum</span> (customs of the ancestors). When ambition overcame tradition, the constitution proved inadequate to preserve the Republic.</p>

                    importance: 'Key check on magisterial power. Tribunes could veto any action, while magistrates of equal rank could block colleagues. This power could protect citizens but also paralyse government if misused.'

                    importance: 'Protected tribunes from retaliation for using their veto power. This religious protection was essential for their role as popular champions, but it also made them untouchable when they abused their position.'

                    concept: 'Provocatio',
                    explanation: 'The right of Roman citizens to appeal magistrates\' decisions to the popular assemblies.',
                    importance: 'Fundamental protection against arbitrary punishment. Citizens within Rome could appeal death sentences or severe punishment, limiting magisterial power and ensuring some measure of due process.'

                    concept: 'Mos Maiorum',
                    explanation: 'The "customs of the ancestors" - traditional practices that guided Roman behaviour despite lacking legal force.',
                    importance: 'Much of the Roman constitution depended on voluntary adherence to tradition rather than written law. When ambitious politicians abandoned mos maiorum, the informal constraints on power collapsed.'
