            <div class="card"><h3>Learning Objectives</h3><p class="explanation-text">By the end of this lesson, you will understand Book 10's three major deaths—Pallas, Lausus, and Mezentius—and recognise how these deaths explore themes of youth, pietas, revenge, and war's human cost.</p></div>
            <div class="card"><h3>Book 10: Three Tragic Deaths</h3><p class="explanation-text">Book 10 is structured around three devastating deaths: Pallas (killed by Turnus), Lausus (killed by Aeneas), and Mezentius (killed by Aeneas). Each death has profound consequences and reveals different aspects of heroism, devotion, and mortality.</p>
                <div class="key-point"><div class="key-point-title">Central Pattern</div><div class="key-point-text">All three deaths involve young men (Pallas, Lausus) or fathers (Mezentius) who love their sons. The book explores how war destroys families and how grief drives further violence—Turnus kills Pallas, Aeneas kills Lausus in revenge, then kills Mezentius who dies grieving.</div></key>

            <div class="card"><h3>Setting the Stage</h3>
                <div class="book-section"><h4>Council of the Gods</h4><p>Book 10 opens with Jupiter summoning the gods. Venus complains about Juno's persecution; Juno defends Italian rights. Jupiter declares divine neutrality: "The Fates will find their way" (<em>fata viam invenient</em>). The gods must stop interfering—though both continue to meddle at crucial moments.</p></div>
                <div class="book-section"><h4>Aeneas Returns</h4><p>Aeneas sails back with thirty ships of Etruscan allies. His armour gleams; his shield blazes with prophetic scenes of Rome's future. The sea-nymphs (transformed ships from Book 9) guide him, warning of the siege. He arrives in time to save the Trojans—but too late to save Pallas.</p></div>
                <div class="book-section"><h4>Battle Resumes</h4><p>Aeneas lands his forces and joins battle. The fighting is fierce, with named warriors falling on both sides. The catalogue of deaths creates a sense of mass slaughter, but certain deaths stand out for their emotional and narrative significance.</p></div>

        <div class="section-content" id="pallas">
            <div class="card"><h3>The Death of Pallas</h3>
                <div class="book-section"><h4>Pallas in Battle</h4><p>Young <strong>Pallas</strong>, son of Evander, fights magnificently. He rallies his Arcadian troops, kills enemies, displays courage beyond his years. He is everything a young warrior should be—brave, skilled, inspiring. But his excellence attracts fatal attention.</p></div>
                <div class="book-section"><h4>Turnus Seeks Him Out</h4><p>Turnus, prompted by divine forces, seeks Pallas for single combat. The warriors clear space for the duel. Pallas recognizes Turnus's superiority but will not flee or surrender. He prays to Hercules (his father's patron god) for help.</p></div>
                <div class="book-section"><h4>Hercules Cannot Help</h4><p>Hercules hears the prayer and weeps, knowing he cannot intervene. Jupiter comforts him: "Each man has his day; life is brief for all; but to extend fame through deeds—that is courage's task." Even gods cannot prevent fated deaths. Even heroes must die.</p></div>
                <div class="book-section"><h4>The Fatal Spear</h4><p>Pallas throws his spear—it grazes Turnus's shoulder, wounding but not stopping him. Turnus hurls his spear with full force. It pierces Pallas's shield, his corselet, his chest. The youth falls, dying. Turnus stands over the body, triumphant and cruel.</p></div>
                <div class="rieu-quote"><div class="quote-text">"Tell Evander this, if you complain that I send Pallas back this way: whatever honour there is in death, I grant him. Whatever solace there is in burial, I do not begrudge."</div><div class="quote-attribution">— Turnus over Pallas's body, 10.491-93</div></div>
                <div class="dark-box"><h4>The Belt</h4><p>Turnus strips Pallas's sword-belt—a magnificent piece depicting the Danaids' crime (fifty sisters murdering their husbands on their wedding night). Taking spoils from the dead (<em>spolia</em>) is traditional, but this act seals Turnus's fate. At the poem's end, seeing this belt on Turnus will trigger Aeneas's fatal fury.</p></div>
                <div class="rieu-quote"><div class="quote-text">Nescia mens hominum fati sortisque futurae<br>et servare modum rebus sublata secundis!<br><br>The mind of men, ignorant of fate and future fortune, and unable to keep measure when lifted by success!</div><div class="quote-attribution">— Virgil on Turnus, 10.501-502</div></div>
                <div class="key-point"><div class="key-point-title">Narrative Intervention</div><div class="key-point-text">Virgil breaks his narrative to comment directly: Turnus doesn't know what he's doing. Taking the belt will destroy him. This rare authorial intrusion creates dramatic irony—readers know Turnus's triumph contains his doom. The victor is already doomed by his victory.</div></key>

        <div class="section-content" id="lausus">
            <div class="card"><h3>The Death of Lausus</h3>
                <div class="book-section"><h4>Aeneas's Fury</h4><p>News of Pallas's death reaches Aeneas. His grief explodes into rage. He slaughters enemies without mercy, takes prisoners for human sacrifice (a dark echo of Achilles after Patroclus's death), refuses all quarter. His <em>pietas</em> warps into vengeful <em>furor</em>.</p></div>
                <div class="book-section"><h4>Juno Rescues Turnus</h4><p>Juno, seeing Turnus about to face the raging Aeneas, creates a phantom Aeneas. Turnus chases it onto a ship that carries him away from battle. He is saved but dishonoured—tricked into apparent flight. The intervention postpones the inevitable confrontation.</p></div>
                <div class="book-section"><h4>Mezentius Enters</h4><p><strong>Mezentius</strong>, the exiled Etruscan tyrant, takes Turnus's place. Known as <em>contemptor divum</em> (despiser of the gods), he is cruel, impious, hated. Yet he fights magnificently—perhaps the best warrior on the Italian side. He kills many before Aeneas wounds him in the groin.</p></div>
                <div class="book-section"><h4>Lausus Intervenes</h4><p><strong>Lausus</strong>, Mezentius's young son, throws himself between Aeneas and his wounded father. He knows he cannot match Aeneas but fights anyway, buying time for Mezentius to escape. This devotion to an unworthy father is the highest form of <em>pietas</em>.</p></div>
                <div class="book-section"><h4>Aeneas's Pity</h4><p>Aeneas kills Lausus but immediately feels pity and remorse. Looking at the dying youth, he sees reflected his own devotion to Anchises: "What can I give you worthy of such deeds, brave youth? Keep your beloved armour. I return you to your ancestors' shades, if that matters to you."</p></div>
                <div class="rieu-quote"><div class="quote-text">"What reward can I give worthy of such praise, young man so magnificent? Keep the armour you loved. I return you to the shades and ashes of your parents, if that concerns you at all."</div><div class="quote-attribution">— Aeneas to dying Lausus, 10.825-27</div></div>
                <div class="key-point"><div class="key-point-title">Mirrored Devotion</div><div class="key-point-text">Aeneas recognizes himself in Lausus—a son who loves his father beyond reason. The enemy becomes human through shared values. Yet Aeneas killed him anyway. War forces good men to destroy what they admire. This is tragedy, not triumph.</div></key>

        <div class="section-content" id="mezentius">
            <div class="card"><h3>The Death of Mezentius</h3>
                <div class="book-section"><h4>Mezentius's Character</h4><p><strong>Mezentius</strong> is introduced as a villain: tyrant, torturer, despiser of gods. His cruelties drove the Etruscans to exile him. He represents everything Rome opposed—impiety, tyranny, contempt for divine order. He should be simply hateful.</p></div>
                <div class="book-section"><h4>His Warhorse</h4><p>Wounded, Mezentius retreats to the river. His beloved warhorse <strong>Rhaebus</strong> supports him while he binds his wounds. The tender moment between warrior and horse humanizes Mezentius. Even monsters love something.</p></div>
                <div class="book-section"><h4>Learning of Lausus's Death</h4><p>Mezentius hears that Lausus died defending him. His grief is absolute. He has lost his only son, who sacrificed himself for an unworthy father. All Mezentius's power, all his contempt for gods, cannot prevent this loss. He is broken.</p></div>
                <div class="book-section"><h4>Return to Battle</h4><p>Mezentius mounts Rhaebus and rides back to fight Aeneas, knowing he will die. He wants to die. Living with the knowledge that his son died for him is unbearable. Death becomes mercy, not punishment. He fights not for victory but for an honourable end.</p></div>
                <div class="book-section"><h4>The Final Duel</h4><p>Mezentius charges Aeneas repeatedly. Aeneas kills Rhaebus; the horse falls on Mezentius, pinning him. Mezentius accepts his death: "If you have any human feeling, I ask only this—let earth cover me and my son together. I know the bitter hatred my people have for me. Ward off their fury and grant me a shared tomb."</p></div>
                <div class="rieu-quote"><div class="quote-text">"Enemy, you have won. I do not beg for life. I never came here thinking I would. But this I ask: if any pity touches the victor, let earth cover me. Let me lie in the grave with my son."</div><div class="quote-attribution">— Mezentius to Aeneas, 10.903-6</div></div>
                <div class="dark-box"><h4>Transformation Through Death</h4><p>Mezentius dies not as a monster but as a grieving father. His final request—to be buried with Lausus—reveals his humanity. The despiser of gods becomes pitiable through love and loss. Even the wicked love their children; even they deserve burial.</p></div>
                <div class="key-point"><div class="key-point-title">Complex Sympathy</div><div class="key-point-text">Virgil's sympathy extends even to Mezentius. The tyrant becomes tragic through his son's death. This complicates simple moral readings: good and evil blur in the face of love and grief. Aeneas kills his enemy but recognizes shared humanity. War makes no one wholly victor.</div></key>
