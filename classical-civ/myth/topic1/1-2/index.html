                            <p><strong>Remember:</strong> Each god had specific <span class="key-term" onclick="showDefinition('iconography')">iconography</span> - visual symbols that made them instantly recognisable in art. These symbols were related to their powers and responsibilities.</p>

                    <h2>Identifying Gods in Ancient Art</h2>
                    
                    <p>Ancient artists used consistent <span class="key-term" onclick="showDefinition('iconography')">iconographic symbols</span> to make gods instantly recognisable. These visual clues were essential in a world where many people couldn't read but needed to identify divine figures in temples, on pottery, and in public art.</p>

                    <h3>Key Identification Principles</h3>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Attributes:</strong> Objects associated with the god's power (Zeus's thunderbolt, Poseidon's trident)</li>
                        <li><strong>Animals:</strong> Sacred creatures that accompanied gods (Athena's owl, Hera's peacock)</li>
                        <li><strong>Clothing and appearance:</strong> Specific garments or physical features (Dionysus's ivy crown, Apollo's youthful beauty)</li>
                        <li><strong>Context:</strong> Activities or settings that reveal identity (Hephaestus at a forge, Artemis hunting)</li>
                    </ul>

                            "The artists give to each god the symbols by which they may be known: to Zeus the thunderbolt, to Poseidon the trident, to Apollo the lyre."

                    <p><span class="key-term" onclick="showDefinition('epithets')">Epithets</span> were additional names that specified particular aspects or local versions of a god. Understanding epithets is crucial for interpreting ancient texts and religious practices.</p>

                    <h2>Greek vs Roman: More Than Just Names</h2>
                    
                    <p>While the Romans adopted Greek gods, they often emphasised different aspects based on their cultural values. Understanding these differences helps explain variations in ancient art and literature.</p>

                    <h3>Key Differences</h3>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Mars vs Ares:</strong> The Greeks saw Ares as brutal and chaotic, often mocked in myths. Romans honoured Mars as a noble protector, father of Romulus and defender of the state.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Minerva vs Athena:</strong> While both were wisdom goddesses, Minerva had stronger associations with crafts and trade guilds in Rome, reflecting Roman commercial interests.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Diana vs Artemis:</strong> Diana absorbed attributes from local Italian goddesses, becoming more associated with the moon and women's mysteries than her Greek counterpart.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Bacchus vs Dionysus:</strong> Romans initially resisted Dionysian worship as foreign and dangerous, leading to the suppression of <span class="key-term" onclick="showDefinition('bacchanalia')">Bacchanalia</span> in 186 BC.</li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h2>Gods in Art: From Pottery to Temples</h2>
                    
                    <p>Gods appeared everywhere in ancient art - painted on pottery, carved in temple pediments, cast in bronze statues, and struck on coins. Each medium had its own conventions for divine representation.</p>

                    <h3>Common Artistic Conventions</h3>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Scale:</strong> Gods often appeared larger than mortals in the same scene</li>
                        <li><strong>Ideal beauty:</strong> Divine figures showed perfect proportions and ageless features (except Hephaestus)</li>
                        <li><strong>Narrative scenes:</strong> Gods were shown in mythological episodes that revealed their nature</li>
                        <li><strong>Cult statues:</strong> Temple statues showed gods in their most formal, powerful aspect</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The ability to identify gods in art was essential for understanding public monuments, temple decorations, and even everyday objects. This visual literacy was part of basic cultural knowledge in the ancient world.</p>
