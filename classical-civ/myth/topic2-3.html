                    <h3>Why Twelve Labours?</h3>
                    
                    <p><strong>Originally there were only ten labours</strong>, but King Eurystheus discounted two of them:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>The Lernaean Hydra (Labour 2):</strong> Eurystheus claimed this didn't count because Heracles had help from his nephew Iolaus, who cauterised the neck stumps to prevent heads from regrowing.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>The Augean Stables (Labour 5):</strong> Eurystheus refused to count this because King Augeas had offered payment for the work (though he later refused to pay), making it a job rather than a labour.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Because of these disqualifications, Eurystheus demanded two additional labours, extending Heracles' service and sending him on even more dangerous quests - including fetching the Golden Apples of the Hesperides and capturing Cerberus from the Underworld itself.</p>

            <p><strong>Why the Labours at Olympia?</strong> The Temple of Zeus (c. 470-456 BCE) displayed Heracles' labours because he was believed to be the founder of the Olympic Games. The sculptural program celebrated the hero's journey from sin to redemption - a perfect message for athletes seeking glory through struggle.</p>
            
            <p><strong>The Sacred Order:</strong> The labours were arranged to tell a story of progression - from local Peloponnesian monsters to distant lands, finally reaching the supernatural realm. This geographic and spiritual journey mirrored the athlete's own path to excellence.</p>

        analysis: "The artist emphasized Heracles' divine strength through exaggerated musculature and the lion's massive size. This was placed prominently as it represented the beginning of Heracles' heroic transformation."

        title: "The Lernaean Hydra",
        location: "Lake Lerna, near Argos",
        description: "The metope depicts Heracles wielding his club while Iolaus tends the fire used to cauterize the Hydra's necks. Multiple serpentine heads writhe around the hero, showing the creature's regenerative horror.",
        analysis: "This sculpture teaches that even heroes need help - a humble lesson for competitive athletes. The collaborative nature of this labour made it controversial when Eurystheus discounted it."

        title: "Erymanthian Boar",
        location: "Mount Erymanthus, Arcadia",
        description: "Heracles is shown wrestling the massive boar in deep snow, his powerful frame contrasted against the beast's tusked fury. The sculpture captures the moment of the hero's victory through superior technique.",
        analysis: "The snowy mountain setting adds environmental challenge to physical contest - like athletes competing in harsh conditions. The boar's capture alive showed mastery over nature."

        title: "Augean Stables",
        location: "Elis, western Peloponnese",
        description: "This unique metope shows Heracles redirecting river water through the stables. Rather than depicting muscle, it celebrates intelligence and engineering - the mind conquering what strength alone could not.",
        analysis: "Placed at Olympia (in Elis), this labour had special local significance. It demonstrated that cleverness could achieve what seemed impossible - inspiring athletes to use strategy as well as strength."
    },
    6: {
        title: "Stymphalian Birds",
        location: "Lake Stymphalia, Arcadia",
        description: "Heracles is shown with the bronze castanets given by Athena, driving the man-eating birds from their marsh. The sculptor depicted the birds in mid-flight, creating dynamic movement across the stone.",
        analysis: "Divine assistance through Athena's gift taught that the gods favor those who earn their help through previous deeds. Athletes understood they needed divine blessing alongside training."
    },
    7: {
        title: "Cretan Bull",
        location: "Crete",
        description: "The metope captures Heracles wrestling the fire-breathing bull, his lion-skin cloak flowing behind him. The bull's divine power is shown through its imposing size and fierce expression.",
        analysis: "This labour marked Heracles' expansion beyond the Peloponnese. For Olympic visitors from across Greece, it showed heroism had no geographic limits - the games truly were Panhellenic."
    },
    8: {
        title: "Mares of Diomedes",
        location: "Thrace",
        description: "A tragic scene showing the aftermath of the horses' rampage, with Heracles mourning his friend Abderus. The man-eating mares are depicted with wild eyes and bared teeth, emphasizing their unnatural savagery.",
        analysis: "This metope introduced the theme of heroic loss - even success can carry tragic cost. Athletes learned that victory sometimes requires painful sacrifice."
    },
    9: {
        title: "Belt of Hippolyta",
        location: "Themiscyra, land of the Amazons",
        description: "The sculpture shows the climactic battle with the Amazons, Heracles fighting the warrior queen while her army charges. The dynamic composition emphasizes the chaos of battle and Hera's cruel interference.",
        analysis: "This labour warned against trusting appearances - what seemed like diplomacy became warfare through divine manipulation. Athletes learned to expect unexpected challenges."
    },
    10: {
        title: "Cattle of Geryon",
        location: "Erytheia, far western edge of the world",
        description: "Heracles faces the three-bodied monster Geryon while driving the red cattle. The sculptor showed all three of Geryon's bodies to emphasize the creature's supernatural nature and the labour's difficulty.",
        analysis: "Reaching the edge of the world, Heracles established the Pillars of Heracles (Gibraltar). This labour showed heroism expanding the boundaries of the known world - like Olympic competition spreading Greek culture."
    },
    11: {
        title: "Apples of the Hesperides",
        location: "Garden of the Hesperides, far west",
        description: "The famous scene of Atlas returning with the golden apples while Heracles holds up the sky. The sculptor captured the moment of Atlas's attempted deception and Heracles' patient endurance.",
        analysis: "Literally supporting the heavens proved Heracles had divine-level strength. The clever trick with Atlas showed that even heroes must use wit against superior opponents - brain over brawn."
    },

        title: "Cerberus",
        location: "The Underworld",

                    <h4>Personal Redemption</h4>
                    <p>The labours transformed Heracles from a man guilty of killing his family into a purified hero. Each labour represented a step in his journey from guilt to redemption, from mortality toward immortality.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Civilising Force</h4>
                    <p>By defeating monsters and clearing dangerous beasts, Heracles made the world safer for humanity. He represents civilisation triumphing over the wild, order defeating chaos.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Geographic Scope</h4>
                    <p>The labours took Heracles from local challenges in the Peloponnese to the edges of the earth and even to the Underworld. This progression showed his growing power and the universal scope of his heroism.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Divine Testing</h4>
                    <p>Though initiated by Hera's hatred, the labours ultimately proved Heracles worthy of divinity. By succeeding where any mortal would fail, he earned his place among the gods.</p>

                    <h3>From Labour to Glory</h3>
                    
                    <p>The Twelve Labours stand as the greatest series of heroic deeds in Greek mythology. They showcase every aspect of heroism:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Physical strength:</strong> Wrestling lions, holding up the sky</li>
                        <li><strong>Cleverness:</strong> Diverting rivers, tricking Atlas</li>
                        <li><strong>Perseverance:</strong> Pursuing the hind for a year</li>
                        <li><strong>Courage:</strong> Descending to the Underworld</li>
                        <li><strong>Humility:</strong> Serving a cowardly king for twelve years</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>The representation of these labours on the Temple of Zeus at Olympia, the most important Panhellenic sanctuary, shows their central importance to Greek culture. Here, at the site where Heracles founded the Olympic Games, his labours were immortalised in stone, inspiring athletes and pilgrims for centuries.</p>
                    
                    <p>Through these impossible tasks, Heracles proved that even the greatest sin could be redeemed through suffering and service. His labours became a template for heroism - showing that true greatness comes not from avoiding failure, but from accepting responsibility and working toward redemption.</p>
