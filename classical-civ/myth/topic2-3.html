                        "The Pythia told him to dwell in Tiryns, serving Eurystheus for twelve years and to perform the labours imposed upon him, and thus, she said, when the labours were accomplished, he would be immortal."

                    <h3>Why Twelve Labours?</h3>
                    
                    <p><strong>Originally there were only ten labours</strong>, but King Eurystheus discounted two of them:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>The Lernaean Hydra (Labour 2):</strong> Eurystheus claimed this didn't count because Heracles had help from his nephew Iolaus, who cauterised the neck stumps to prevent heads from regrowing.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>The Augean Stables (Labour 5):</strong> Eurystheus refused to count this because King Augeas had offered payment for the work (though he later refused to pay), making it a job rather than a labour.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Because of these disqualifications, Eurystheus demanded two additional labours, extending Heracles' service and sending him on even more dangerous quests - including fetching the Golden Apples of the Hesperides and capturing Cerberus from the Underworld itself.</p>

                                <p>A monstrous lion terrorised the region of Nemea, devouring livestock and humans alike. This was no ordinary beast - it was the offspring of the monsters Typhon and Echidna, with a golden hide that no weapon could pierce. The lion had made its lair in a cave with two entrances, from which it would emerge to devastate the countryside.</p>
                                
                                <p>When Heracles arrived, he first tried his arrows, but they bounced harmlessly off the golden fur. His sword bent when he struck the beast, and his club shattered against its skull. Realising conventional weapons were useless, Heracles cornered the lion in its cave, blocked one entrance, and entered through the other.</p>
                                
                                <p>In the darkness of the cave, man and beast wrestled. Using his incredible strength, Heracles wrapped his mighty arms around the lion's neck and strangled it to death. He then faced a new problem - how to skin a beast whose hide couldn't be cut? Athena appeared and advised him to use the lion's own claws. From then on, Heracles wore the invulnerable pelt as armour, with the lion's head serving as his helmet.</p>

                                <p>In the swamps of Lerna lurked a serpentine horror - the Hydra, another child of Typhon and Echidna. This water snake had nine heads (some say more), with the central head being immortal. Its breath and blood were deadly poison, and it had been raised by Hera specifically to kill Heracles.</p>
                                
                                <p>Heracles arrived with his nephew Iolaus as his charioteer. He forced the Hydra from its lair by shooting flaming arrows into the swamp. As they fought, Heracles discovered the creature's terrible secret - when he cut off one head, two more grew in its place. To make matters worse, Hera sent a giant crab to attack Heracles' feet (which he crushed, and which became the constellation Cancer).</p>
                                
                                <p>Realising he needed help, Heracles called upon Iolaus. His nephew brought burning branches from a nearby forest. As Heracles cut off each head, Iolaus immediately cauterised the wound with fire, preventing regeneration. The immortal head Heracles cut off and buried under a massive rock. Before leaving, he dipped his arrows in the Hydra's poisonous blood, creating weapons that would prove fatal with even the smallest wound.</p>

            <p>On the slopes of Mount Erymanthus lived a monstrous boar that ravaged the countryside of Arcadia. Its tusks were like swords, its hide thick as armour, and its temper so fierce that hunters fled at the mere sound of its approach. Eurystheus commanded that this beast be brought back alive.</p>
            
            <p>On his way to Mount Erymanthus, Heracles stopped to visit his friend Pholus, a civilised centaur. When Heracles asked for wine, Pholus opened a jar that belonged to all centaurs collectively. The scent attracted the other centaurs, who attacked in fury. Heracles defended himself with his poisoned arrows, accidentally wounding his friend Chiron, the immortal centaur teacher. The poison caused Chiron such agony that he later gave up his immortality to escape the pain.</p>
            
            <p>Reaching Mount Erymanthus, Heracles found the boar's tracks in the snow. He shouted and made noise to drive the beast from its thicket, then chased it higher up the mountain into deep snowdrifts. The boar, exhausted from struggling through the snow, could no longer flee or fight effectively. Heracles leaped upon its back and bound it with chains. He then carried the enormous beast on his shoulders back to Tiryns. When Eurystheus saw Heracles approaching with the snarling boar, the cowardly king jumped into a large bronze storage jar and hid, begging Heracles to get rid of the creature.</p>

            <p>King Augeas of Elis owned more cattle than any other man on earth - three thousand oxen, including twelve prize bulls that were white as snow and dedicated to Helios, the sun god. These vast herds had been kept in stables that hadn't been cleaned for thirty years. The filth was piled so high that it had become impossible to enter, and the stench poisoned the air for miles around. Eurystheus, believing this task impossible to complete in a single day, ordered Heracles to clean the stables.</p>
            
            <p>Heracles went to King Augeas and, without mentioning Eurystheus, offered to clean the stables in a single day in exchange for one-tenth of the cattle. Augeas laughed at the impossible boast and readily agreed, even calling his son Phyleus as a witness to the bargain. Heracles then made two great breaches in the stable walls and diverted the courses of two rivers - the Alpheus and the Peneus.</p>
            
            <p>The rushing waters swept through the stables like a flood, washing away thirty years of filth in a matter of hours. The stables were left cleaner than they had ever been. But when Heracles came to collect his payment, Augeas had learned about Eurystheus and refused to honour the deal, claiming Heracles was already bound to do the task. When Phyleus testified in Heracles' favour, Augeas banished both his son and Heracles from the kingdom. Later, Heracles would return with an army to claim his payment by force. Eurystheus, meanwhile, refused to count this labour because Heracles had sought payment for it.</p>

            <p>Lake Stymphalia was surrounded by dense forests and marshes, the perfect hiding place for a flock of man-eating birds. These were no ordinary creatures - they had beaks of bronze that could pierce armour, metallic feathers they could launch like arrows, and their toxic dung poisoned the land and water. Sacred to Ares, god of war, they had multiplied until they darkened the sky in flight, terrorising the entire region.</p>
            
            <p>When Heracles arrived at the lake, he found the task more difficult than expected. The marshy ground wouldn't support his weight to reach the birds, and they hid deep in the thick forest where his arrows couldn't reach them. He stood at the lake's edge, frustrated by this seemingly simple task that had become impossible.</p>
            
            <p>Athena, taking pity on the hero, appeared with a gift from Hephaestus - a pair of bronze castanets (krotala) that produced a sound so loud and sharp it could drive any creature to madness. Heracles climbed to a high point overlooking the lake and clashed the castanets together. The noise was tremendous, echoing across the water and through the forest. The birds burst from their hiding places in panic, filling the air in a great cloud. As they fled in terror, Heracles shot them down with his arrows, the same poisoned with the Hydra's blood. Those that escaped flew far away to the Island of Ares in the Black Sea, never to return to Greece.</p>

            <p>The Cretan Bull had a divine origin. King Minos of Crete had prayed to Poseidon to send him a sign of favour - a bull from the sea that he would then sacrifice back to the god. Poseidon sent a magnificent white bull, so beautiful that Minos couldn't bear to kill it. He sacrificed another bull instead, keeping the divine one for himself. In punishment, Poseidon made the bull savage and caused Minos' wife Pasipha√´ to fall in love with it - a union that would produce the Minotaur.</p>
            
            <p>By the time Heracles arrived, the bull was ravaging Crete, breathing fire, uprooting crops, and destroying orchard walls. The creature had become a terror that no one could approach. Minos, perhaps relieved to be rid of this reminder of his family's shame, gave Heracles permission to take the bull if he could.</p>
            
            <p>Heracles tracked the bull to its grazing ground and approached it fearlessly. When it charged, breathing fire, Heracles dodged aside and grabbed its horns. Using his incredible strength, he wrestled the bull to the ground and held it until it was subdued. Some say he rode the bull across the sea back to Greece like a ship, the divine beast walking on the waves. When he presented it to Eurystheus, the king dedicated it to Hera, but the goddess refused the offering from her enemy. The bull was released and wandered to Marathon, where it would later be captured by Theseus.</p>

He owned four mares - Podargos (swift), Lampon (shining), Xanthos (yellow), and Deinos (terrible) - magnificent creatures with one horrifying trait: they were fed on human flesh. Diomedes kept them tethered with iron chains to bronze mangers, feeding them the flesh of unsuspecting guests and strangers who came to his palace. The horses had become so savage that they breathed fire and their madness was infectious.</p>

            <p>Returning to the mares, Heracles found tragedy - the horses had devoured young Abderus. In his grief and rage, Heracles fed Diomedes to his own mares. Eating the flesh of their master seemed to cure their madness, or perhaps it was divine justice that calmed them. The horses became tame enough for Heracles to bind their mouths shut and lead them back to Eurystheus. The king dedicated them to Hera and set them free. They were eventually eaten by wild beasts on Mount Olympus, or according to some, their descendants survived until the time of Alexander the Great. Heracles founded the city of Abdera in honor of his fallen companion.</p>

This was no ordinary ornament - it was a gift from Ares, god of war, to his daughter, symbolising her authority as queen of the warrior women. The Amazons were a nation of female warriors who lived without men, meeting neighbouring tribes only to produce children, keeping the girls and sending away the boys.</p>

The Amazons armed themselves and charged toward the ship in full battle array. Seeing the attack, Heracles believed Hippolyta had betrayed him. In the ensuing battle, Heracles killed Hippolyta and took the belt from her body. Some say he took the Amazon Antiope as well, who became Theseus' wife. The Greeks fought their way back to the sea and sailed away with the belt, leaving the Amazons mourning their queen. The belt was given to Eurystheus, who dedicated it in the temple of Hera at Argos.</p>

            <p>Geryon was a monster with three heads, three bodies joined at the waist, and six arms. He lived on the island of Erytheia, far in the western ocean beyond the edge of the known world. There he kept a herd of magnificent red cattle, guarded by the herdsman Eurytion and the two-headed dog Orthrus, brother of Cerberus. To reach this distant land, Heracles had to journey to the very edge of the world.</p>
            
            <p>When Heracles reached the straits that separate Europe from Africa, he set up two great pillars to mark his journey - the Pillars of Heracles (modern Gibraltar). The heat of the sun in these southern lands was so intense that Heracles, in frustration, shot an arrow at Helios. The sun god, admiring his boldness, lent him his golden cup - the vessel in which Helios sailed each night from west to east. In this magical boat, Heracles sailed to Erytheia.</p>
            
            <p>Upon landing, he was immediately attacked by Orthrus, whom he killed with his club. When the herdsman Eurytion came to investigate, Heracles killed him too. As he was driving the cattle toward the shore, Geryon himself appeared, alerted by another herdsman. Heracles shot him with a single arrow that pierced all three of his bodies at once - the arrow poisoned with the Hydra's blood ensuring his death. The return journey with the cattle became an epic trek across Europe, during which Heracles had many adventures, fought giants in Italy, and established several cities. When he finally delivered the cattle to Eurystheus, the king sacrificed them to Hera.</p>

            <p>The golden apples grew in a garden at the western edge of the world, where the Titan Atlas held up the sky. These apples were a wedding gift from Gaia to Hera when she married Zeus, and were tended by the Hesperides, daughters of the evening, and guarded by Ladon, an immortal dragon with a hundred heads that never slept. The location of this garden was a closely guarded secret.</p>
            
            <p>Heracles first had to find the garden. He wrestled the sea-god Nereus, the Old Man of the Sea, who could change his shape. Though Nereus transformed into fire, water, and many animals, Heracles held tight until the god revealed the location. The journey took Heracles through Libya, Egypt (where he killed the king Busiris who tried to sacrifice him), and to the Caucasus Mountains where he freed Prometheus from his eternal torment, killing the eagle that daily devoured his liver.</p>
            
            <p>When Heracles finally reached the garden, he found Atlas nearby, condemned to hold the heavens on his shoulders for eternity. Heracles proposed a bargain: he would hold the sky while Atlas, who was the father of the Hesperides, fetched the apples. Atlas eagerly agreed, grateful for any relief from his burden. But when Atlas returned with the golden apples, he decided he didn't want to take the sky back, offering to deliver the apples to Eurystheus himself. Heracles pretended to agree but asked Atlas to hold the sky for just a moment while he adjusted his cloak as padding. As soon as Atlas took back the heavens, Heracles picked up the apples and left. The apples were given to Eurystheus but, being divine property, were returned by Athena to the garden.</p>

        <div class="labour-narrative">
            <p>For his final labour, Eurystheus demanded the impossible: bring back Cerberus, the three-headed hellhound that guarded the gates of the Underworld, preventing the dead from leaving and the living from entering. This was a journey from which no mortal had ever returned. Cerberus had three dog heads, a serpent for a tail, and snakes growing from his back.</p>
            
            <p>To prepare for this ultimate challenge, Heracles first traveled to Eleusis to be initiated into the Eleusinian Mysteries, sacred rites that promised initiates a blessed afterlife. This spiritual preparation was essential for a living man entering the realm of the dead. Guided by Hermes and Athena, Heracles descended through the cave at Taenarum in Laconia.</p>
            
            <p>In the Underworld, the shades of the dead fled before him, all except the hero Meleager and the Gorgon Medusa. Heracles drew his sword against Medusa, but Hermes reminded him she was now just an empty phantom. He freed Theseus, who had been imprisoned for trying to kidnap Persephone, though Pirithous remained trapped forever. When Heracles reached the throne of Hades and Persephone, he asked permission to take Cerberus. Hades agreed on one condition: Heracles must subdue the beast using no weapons, only his bare hands.</p>
            
            <p>Heracles found Cerberus at the gates of Acheron. Protected by the lion's pelt from the beast's bites, he wrestled Cerberus into submission, wrapping his mighty arms around the creature's throats. Though the serpent tail bit him and the snakes hissed, Heracles maintained his grip until Cerberus yielded. He carried the subdued hellhound up to the living world. When Eurystheus saw Heracles approaching with Cerberus, the terrified king hid in his bronze jar and begged Heracles to return the monster to the Underworld. Having completed all twelve labours, Heracles was finally free. He returned Cerberus to Hades as promised, and his servitude to Eurystheus ended.</p>

                    <p>By defeating monsters and clearing dangerous beasts, Heracles made the world safer for humanity. He represents civilisation triumphing over the wild, order defeating chaos.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Geographic Scope</h4>
                    <p>The labours took Heracles from local challenges in the Peloponnese to the edges of the earth and even to the Underworld. This progression showed his growing power and the universal scope of his heroism.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Divine Testing</h4>
                    <p>Though initiated by Hera's hatred, the labours ultimately proved Heracles worthy of divinity. By succeeding where any mortal would fail, he earned his place among the gods.</p>

                    <h3>From Labour to Glory</h3>
                    
                    <p>The Twelve Labours stand as the greatest series of heroic deeds in Greek mythology. They showcase every aspect of heroism:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Physical strength:</strong> Wrestling lions, holding up the sky</li>
                        <li><strong>Cleverness:</strong> Diverting rivers, tricking Atlas</li>
                        <li><strong>Perseverance:</strong> Pursuing the hind for a year</li>
                        <li><strong>Courage:</strong> Descending to the Underworld</li>
                        <li><strong>Humility:</strong> Serving a cowardly king for twelve years</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>The representation of these labours on the Temple of Zeus at Olympia, the most important Panhellenic sanctuary, shows their central importance to Greek culture. Here, at the site where Heracles founded the Olympic Games, his labours were immortalised in stone, inspiring athletes and pilgrims for centuries.</p>
                    
                    <p>Through these impossible tasks, Heracles proved that even the greatest sin could be redeemed through suffering and service. His labours became a template for heroism - showing that true greatness comes not from avoiding failure, but from accepting responsibility and working toward redemption.</p>
