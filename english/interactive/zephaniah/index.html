                        As a child I suffered, but learned to turn dyslexia to my advantage, to see the world

                        with the education system then was that there was no compassion, no understanding

                        there's a God isn't that a design fault? If you've built something, you want efficiency. If I
                        was God I would have designed sleep so we could stay awake. Then good people could
                        do one-third more good in the world."</span>

                        a teacher said, "It's all right. We can't all be intelligent, but you'll end up being a good
                        sportsperson, so why don't you go outside and play some football?"</span>

                        <span class="highlight purpose" data-analysis="thirteen-read">When I was 13 I could read very basically but it would be such hard

                        fighting.</span>
